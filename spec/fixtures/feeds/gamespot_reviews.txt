<item><title>Beyond: Two Souls Review</title><link>http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/beyond-two-souls-review/1900-6416326/</link><description><![CDATA[<p style="">The PS4 port of Beyond: Two Souls doesn’t fix the game's core issues. It’s still a very stilted, awkward experience in spots, usually right after a stretch where the gameplay and narrative get everything right. What it does do--thanks to this edition’s best new feature, where the timeline-hopping narrative can be played in chronological order--is strip away some of the high-concept pretense and deliver a straightforward story that's stronger as a result.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Beyond: Two Souls is about the life of Jodie Holmes (performed by Ellen Page), a girl who, since birth, has been tethered to an otherworldly entity named Aidan. Naturally, having a poltergeist as an impulsive companion doesn’t exactly equal an ideal life--especially since Aidan’s presence leaves Jodie open to frequent visits from the malevolent side of the hereafter. But even when she’s not being dragged around by invisible horrors, Jodie still has to contend with Aidan’s mischievous tendencies. And on days when Aidan is calm, there’s just life as a socially awkward girl who sees things that nobody should ever have to see. We follow Jodie over a stretch of 15 years, watching her deal with the world--and the world deal with her--and make decisions that change the course of her life.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977881-beyondtwosouls2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2977881" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1280px"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977881-beyondtwosouls2.jpg"><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2977881-beyondtwosouls2.jpg"></a><figcaption>This experiment went well.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Beyond feels right at home on PS4. Textures are noticeably upgraded from the PS3 version and lighting improvements galore create an even more stunning cinematic experience. The actual playing of Beyond hasn’t changed significantly in the transition to PS4. For the most part, it’s still a copy-paste job from Heavy Rain. Most of your time is spent wandering through closed environments, looking for the magical prompt that signifies when you can interact with an object or person.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">In keeping with Quantic Dream's trademark style, action is handled by quick time events in a dynamic fashion, taking full advantage of the DualShock 4's motion-sensing functionality. The PS4 edition of the game does add a few tricky bits, where QTEs use diagonals instead of normal up-down-left-right prompts, but those only pop up in two of the chapters. The timing of the prompts seems stricter, which means that Jodie is liable to take a few more brutal hits when the going gets tough, but the QTEs don’t determine the course of the story so much as they bring the action to life. Yes, you could, in theory, just set the controller down during an action scene and let it play out on its own, but you’d be watching a sequence of Jodie getting the crap kicked out of her ad nauseum. Actively participating in Jodie's struggle is much more gratifying.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977895-beyondtwosouls4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2977895" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1280px"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977895-beyondtwosouls4.jpg"><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2977895-beyondtwosouls4.jpg"></a><figcaption>If only she had a Fulton baloon.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Through the course of the game, the best moments in each action scene require your input, whether you're jumping between moving vehicles, tossing soldiers into the road, stealing a motorcycle, blowing past a police garrison, or saving people from a burning building. There are even a few scattered sequences of stealth combat, where Jodie tackles hapless bad guys into the dirt.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Beyond’s big hook, of course, is the fact that, any time you have full control over Jodie, you can instantly switch to Aidan and roam the world as a phantom, floating through doors, walls, and objects, listening to secret conversations, force-pushing objects around, choking the life out of folks, or even possessing hapless victims. The seams of the gimmick show often. It’s built into the story that Aidan can actively hurt Jodie if he travels too far, but how far exactly seems to be determined by the needs of the scene rather than consistent logic.</p><blockquote data-size="large"><p dir="ltr" style="">Beyond feels right at home on PS4. Textures are noticeably upgraded from the PS3 version and lighting improvements galore create an even more stunning cinematic experience.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">Having said that, the puzzles, obstacles, and story points built around Aidan’s powers are wonderfully plotted. A painful goodbye interrupted by Jodie’s irritating father can be salvaged if you choose to give him a much-deserved goodbye choke. More than once, Aidan will have to rescue Jodie from a sticky situation by possessing one of her enemies, forcing him to kill his friends and then himself. Its seldom that we get to see a story through the eyes of a spirit, and the extent to which its used in Beyond leads to some fascinating conclusions.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">The chronological version of this story told in the new PS4 version is a marked improvement over the original, where the key points of Jodie’s life were scrambled up and presented as a random series of disparate moments as opposed to a life flashing linearly before her eyes. As a chronological narrative, we get a much better sense of the burden of Jodie’s powers, watching her grow from a curious but sheltered child into a rebellious teenager who longs to live in the real world, and ultimately, into a young woman who finds herself routinely beaten by society.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977893-beyondtwosouls3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2977893" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1280px"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977893-beyondtwosouls3.jpg"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2977893-beyondtwosouls3.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2977893-beyondtwosouls3.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Page and Dafoe deliver excellent performances.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Much of the story's impact can be laid at the feet of Page. Her performance, both vocal and physical, is powerful; it retreats to hollowly call upon the full weight of Jodie’s collective traumas in one scene, using the same trauma to fuel a deep, embittered rage in the next. Willem Dafoe brings a similar gravitas. His side of the script is steeped in exposition, especially toward the end, but there are times when he demonstrates genuine warmth and paternal concern for Jodie--traits we rarely see from Dafoe. The supporting cast varies. Kadeem Hardison, the only other “name” actor in the game, is solid in his role, but elsewhere, actors fail to keep up and weigh down scenes with poor acting that contrasts with Beyond's more capable cast members.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr" style="">Beyond remains an imperfect experience but is still compelling for what it accomplishes.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">They’re bound to Beyond's schizophrenic script, which flips between sequences of earnest, pensive drama, high-octane action, and well-directed but conceptually goofy supernatural blather. The highs are spectacular: The sequence where Jodie deals with homelessness stands out, and a scene where she reunites with a heavily medicated relative is brutally harrowing. The lows, however, are bewildering in their shallowness: An eye-rolling incident at a bar, a detour into Navajo mythology, and a character’s sudden shift into comic book villainy ultimately disappoint. Occasionally, there are scenes like Jodie’s solo mission to take down an African dictator, which, while delivering a stellar dose of action, feels disconnected from the overarching narrative.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Beyond remains a unique experience, even as the tools implemented in its creation have become commonplace. It's filled with concepts that are immediately odd and illogical, but if you accept them on their own terms, they add up to a fascinating if unconventional tale. Beyond remains an imperfect experience but is still compelling for what it accomplishes.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Dec 2015 10:01:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416326</guid><dc:creator>Justin Clark</dc:creator><media:content url="http://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1406/14063904/2977872-2198135861-REVIE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /></item>
<item><title>Yakuza 5 Review</title><link>http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/yakuza-5-review/1900-6416325/</link><description><![CDATA[<p style="">Diving back into Japan’s criminal underworld with Yakuza mainstay Kazuma Kiryu as its narrative anchor is like jumping into another season of a well-received cable TV drama. It usually doesn’t take eight years for a show to reach its fifth season but Yakuza 5 was worth the wait. It even manages to be more feature-rich than its predecessors thanks to a robust set of stories and minigames spread across multiple urban districts across Japan. Savoring Yakuza 5 is about being pulled in by not only its woven plotlines and energetic combat, but also the numerous activities that bring its world to life.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Just like the games of Brendan McNamara (<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/the-getaway">The Getaway</a>, <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/l-a-noire">L.A. Noire</a>), the Yakuza series has always belonged at that end of the urban open world game spectrum where gameplay takes a backseat to story. We’re talking about <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> levels of exposition through lengthy cutscenes. Yakuza 5’s heavy themes of honor among criminals and workplace loyalty are aptly presented through the lens and production values of a big budget TV show, and you’d be hard pressed to come up with any game outside this series that features this much melodramatic piano music.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977058-001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2977058" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.56331168831169" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977058-001.jpg"><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2977058-001.jpg"></a><figcaption>Kazuma Kiryu hasn’t aged much since the original Yakuza, and he's never looked better.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">If there’s one key feature from <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/yakuza-4">Yakuza 4</a> that this sequel capitalizes on, it is the value of having multiple stories. As much as Kazuma Kiryu could be effective as a solo protagonist, having four other playable characters, each with their own lengthy and fleshed-out storylines, adds immense value to Yakuza 5. These journeys are personal, and plot threads intertwine like those of a Tarantino film, and converge at the end like a narrative Voltron.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Kazuma kicks off Yakuza 5 on an intriguing note: disguised as a taxi driver making a modest living in Fukuoka. Between highway racing challenges and standard driving missions, there’s a lot of entertaining taxi gameplay to distract you from the story for hours. Unlike other games of its ilk, Yakuza 5 treats driving around city streets as a challenge, with strict traffic laws to follow--until you get on the highways, where anything goes. Another chapter puts you in the shoes of ex-con Taiga Saejima, deep in a snowy forest and far away from the game's concrete jungles This leads to a surprisingly engrossing hunting minigame where stalking prey without startling them is harder than it looks--especially when the intensity of snowfall fluctuates frequently--causing you to take a breath and compose yourself before every shot.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr" style="">Although Yakuza 5 never attempts to be a real simulation of life in Japan, the areas of selective realism within are one of its biggest draws.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">Taxi racing and hunting are just two of myriad diversions that support Yakuza 5's tale, and with over two dozen types of minigames, there's a lot to discover when you're out and about. It’s brilliant that arcades in the game feature an arcade-perfect version of Virtua Fighter 2 and that Namco Bandai’s Taiko Drum Master exists, even if it only has a three-song playlist. Casino games like poker and baccarat are well-represented, as are traditional sports practice areas like batting centers and driving ranges. When enduring the failure of my fifth attempt at grabbing a plush toy from a UFO Catcher, I couldn’t help by recall my struggles at the similar games of chance in Shenmue, and in real life.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977059-003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2977059" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.56092607636068" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977059-003.jpg"><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2977059-003.jpg"></a><figcaption>Yakuza 5 is the closest thing we'll get to a proper Taxi Driver video game. </figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Nothing in Yakuza 5 underscores the series’ passage of time more than Haruka Sawamura’s story arc. Originally the young girl who was the plot’s focal point in the first game, she is now sixteen years old. Her continued and consistent relevance in the series serves as one of the many rewards to fans who have followed Yakuza since the first game. In Haruka's world, there is only one sensible career path for a Japanese teenage girl: idol singer. I afforded myself one eyeroll at this unoriginal premise before I wholeheartedly jumped into the early stages of her burgeoning career.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Given the series’ history with rhythm-based action, mostly through karaoke, this chapter will be familiar to Yakuza fans. It’s not just about matching button inputs to on-screen prompts during a practice session in the dance studio. There are meet-and-greets with fans, appearances on various TV shows, and even dance-offs in the streets.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977061-002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2977061" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.56527043513623" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977061-002.jpg"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1406/14063904/2977061-002.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1406/14063904/2977061-002.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Haruka’s songs are more infectious and tolerable than anything by Sega's Hatsune Miku.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Haruka’s variety show appearances are impressively authentic, not just with the banter between her and the host, but also with the lighting and camerawork. It’s not for everybody, but it's a welcome interlude from the heavy doses of suspense and intrigue in the other plotlines. Still, Yakuza 5 never veers too far from the beaten path, with Rival idols and conflicts with competing management companies providing a dash of drama to Haruka's tale.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Although Yakuza 5 never attempts to be a real simulation of life in Japan, the areas of selective realism within are one of its biggest draws. I still remember walking into a convenience store in the first game and admiring the level of detail, from the magazines to the bright and unflattering overhead lighting. This and many other types of business look all the more detailed in Yakuza 5, right down to the pastel color schemes in the pharmacies. And as much as one can survive the game’s more hostile sections with a boost from energy drinks, sometimes you just want a bowl of health-replenishing ramen or curry. Given all of Yakuza 5’s urban attractions and the vibrancy of most of its various large locales, you’d think that Sega received a subsidy from the Japan National Tourism Organization.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">The core combat in Yakuza 5 is mostly unchanged since the first game and it’s a credit to the series that this hasn’t become totally stale after all these years. Fans will immediately recognize Kazuma’s fighting animations, especially when he’s smashing opponents’ faces with a unusual weapons, including the likes of a bicycle. The tried-and-tested combat serves Yakuza 5 well, but without any type of counter system for self-defense, it shows its age.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977060-004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2977060" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.56061838893409" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977060-004.jpg"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2977060-004.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2977060-004.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>You’d be surprised what Taiga Saejima can pick up.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Make no mistake, though, there is depth to Yakuza 5's combat. Throws, dodges, and opportunities to learn new moves ensure that fights aren't a one-dimensional affair. The series was one of the first street brawlers to include context-sensitive environmental finishing moves, a feature that was improved upon by United Front Games’ Sleeping Dogs, and it's put to great use here. Smashing a thug’s face on the side of a building never gets old; it always looks brutal, but more importantly, it offers a gratifying sense of finality to a fight. As much as you can mash your way to victory with quick attacks, these deadlier moves are doubly effective in scaring off the other gangsters, turning a sixty-second brawl into a fifteen-second display of intimidating might. Of course, moments of slapstick complement the harsh side of combat, including the use of an injured foe as a weapon against his unfortunate buddies, adding insult to injury.</p><blockquote data-align="center" data-size="large"><p dir="ltr" style="">Yakuza 5 makes up for its modest shortcomings with enthralling diversions and eye-popping settings that compel one to look at travel deals to Japan.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">While playing the prior games isn’t a prerequisite, loyal fans who have followed the Yakuza series up to this point will feel rewarded with every throwback, whether it’s the return of a supporting character or a revisit to a ramen shop that has remained in business for multiple games. Even if melee combat lacks the sophistication of modern action games, Yakuza 5 makes up for its modest shortcomings with enthralling diversions and eye-popping settings that compel one to look at travel deals to Japan. Come for the stories, but stick around for Yakuza 5's world; it's unconventional in the best way possible</p><p style=""> </p>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2015 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416325</guid><dc:creator>Miguel Concepcion</dc:creator><media:content url="http://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1406/14063904/2977049-7108485823-Yakuz.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /></item>
<item><title>Rainbow Six Siege Review</title><link>http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rainbow-six-siege-review/1900-6416324/</link><description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" style="">The average <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> multiplayer match contains a surprisingly small amount of shooting. Gunplay is, of course, still central to the Siege experience, but there's so much more to it. You'll spend just as much time strategizing with your teammates, carefully laying traps, reinforcing destructible walls, and feeling your heart race as the dull, distant rumble of your enemies' breach charges suddenly gives way to intense and immediate chaos. And that's just on defense.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Few modern shooters can match the heart-pounding exhilaration and immense strategic depth Siege achieves with its asymmetrical PvP. With no respawns, no regenerating health, and only five players per team, every life suddenly feels meaningful and precious (though you can still monitor security cameras and communicate with your team in death). Running-and-gunning will almost certainly land you on the sidelines, so you're much better off using your drivable drone to scout ahead or coordinating with your teammates to ensure all sightlines are covered.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/542/5424362/2836978-r6s_s06_rappel2_1427391418.png" data-ref-id="1300-2836978" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/542/5424362/2836978-r6s_s06_rappel2_1427391418.png"><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/542/5424362/2836978-r6s_s06_rappel2_1427391418.jpg"></a><figcaption>Siege's spectacular sound design can save your life. Play with headphones on if you want to know exactly where the enemy's approaching from.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Not only does the intense one-life setup encourage players to approach every encounter thoughtfully and methodically, it also fills a long neglected gap in the FPS genre. While shooters that emphasize twitch shooting over tactics can grow tiresome, Siege's seemingly endless array of viable strategies makes every round memorable and organically begets the kind of brilliant, unpredictable moments you can't wait to tell your friends about.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">In any given round, you could repel from a rooftop, smash through a window, and flash the room with a stun grenade, or just lie prone in a dark corner waiting for enemies to wander past. Maybe on defense you'll fortify four team members in a single room but send the fifth out into the wild in hopes of catching the other team off guard. You could also play some mind games by remotely detonating an explosive purely as misdirection before infiltrating through another point of ingress. All these mechanics breed creativity and allow the game to evolve as players develop (and react to) new strategies.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="right"><p dir="ltr" style="">All these mechanics breed creativity and allow the game to evolve as players develop (and react to) new strategies.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">Unfortunately, there is a campaign-sized hole where Siege's single-player should be, and while a carefully crafted, story-driven experience would have further solidified the game's position as one of the year's best shooters, Siege still manages to compensate in other ways. Franchises like <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/halo-5-guardians">Halo</a> and <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-iii">Call of Duty</a> have set the bar for the amount of desirable content you can cram into a game, and Siege clearly falls short of that mark. But consider a game like <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/rocket-league">Rocket League</a>, which has delivered serious longevity with a single game mode. Siege, to me, feels like Rocket League or even <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> in that its pure, competitive nature makes it eminently replayable.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Even outside of its natural competitiveness and deep well of mechanics, Siege's PvP provides enough variables to keep players engaged. There are multiple match types, over a dozen maps, randomized objective locations within those maps, differing times of day for every stage, mixed mode servers that automatically scramble all these options together, and, most importantly, 20 distinct Operators, all of whom open new gameplay avenues. Even characters whose unique gadget seemed useless at first inevitably proved me wrong. I assumed Doc's remote revive dart would never come in handy given that allies are far more often killed than wounded; then I saw someone punch a tiny hole through a wall to revive a fallen teammate pinned by gunfire on the other side.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/542/5424362/2836977-r6s__s09_tight_1427391416.png" data-ref-id="1300-2836977" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/542/5424362/2836977-r6s__s09_tight_1427391416.png"><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/542/5424362/2836977-r6s__s09_tight_1427391416.jpg"></a><figcaption>Environmental destruction plays a major role in Siege's multiplayer.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">And while Siege may not contain a campaign, it does offer 11 singleplayer "Situations" that are both legitimately helpful and surprisingly robust, considering they're essentially training missions. Each situation features three difficulty options and three optional objectives--which enhances their replayability--and each one focuses on a different aspect of the game like bomb defusal or destructible cover. They lack the cohesion, polish, and narrative drive of a campaign, but they're at least diverse enough to prove worthwhile.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">You can also choose to tackle Siege's Terrorist Hunt mode alone, though it's definitely more approachable as a cooperative experience. As with the competitive multiplayer, each player gets one life and only a finite amount of health, but here you must hunt down a preset number of AI-controlled terrorists or disarm bombs while an infinite number of enemies attempt to interfere. Being so outnumbered while having no way to heal turns every round into an intense war of attrition; even if the first guy doesn't kill you outright, he might shave off enough of your health that the next guy can easily take you out. When you make it to the end of a 20-minute round with only a tiny sliver of health remaining, finishing off that final terrorist provides such an incredible high I found it nearly impossible to hold in my reflexive "Hell yeah!"</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Despite all this excess adrenaline, Siege still suffers a few rough edges. The progression system, for example, feels slightly empty and metes out experience too slowly. Thankfully, Casual PvP will be available right out of the gate, but you'll have to accrue enough XP to reach level 20 before you'll unlock Ranked PvP. It makes sense the game would gate Ranked matches given that they remove much of the in-game assistance that makes Casual PvP accessible (a fact the game fails to explain, unfortunately), but grinding all the way to level 20 takes far too long. Why not set the limit lower and let players decide when they're ready?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1365/13658182/2917772-r6s_screenshot_spectatorcamfps_gc_150805_10am_cet_1438625293.png" data-ref-id="1300-2917772" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1365/13658182/2917772-r6s_screenshot_spectatorcamfps_gc_150805_10am_cet_1438625293.png"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1365/13658182/2917772-r6s_screenshot_spectatorcamfps_gc_150805_10am_cet_1438625293.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1365/13658182/2917772-r6s_screenshot_spectatorcamfps_gc_150805_10am_cet_1438625293.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Microtransactions are limited to weapon skins and XP boosts, so you can easily ignore them if you prefer to save your money</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">In addition to XP, players also earn Renown--Siege's version of in-game currency, which can be used to purchase new Operators, weapon attachments, and weapon skins. Again, forcing players to slowly earn new Operators makes some sense: it creates a sense of connection and ownership while encouraging players to really explore and capitalize on each character's unique skills. I was also able to unlock two attackers and two defenders in roughly three hours (thanks in part to some generous boosts early on), and that collection of four Operators proved substantial enough to enable my enjoyment despite limiting my options.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">However, I still encountered situations where my operators had already been selected by other players, which forced me to play as the generic "recruit" stand-in. And more importantly, customization options are extremely limited. You can buy custom sights and scopes or equip your guns with various stabilizers and silencers, but these attachments only marginally impact gameplay, and because you're only outfitting one or two Operators at a time, you'll earn every upgrade with very little effort. This undoubtedly preserves the balance of the game, but it's pretty difficult to feel like you're progressing when there's so little to work towards.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr" style="">Everything from the strength of your internet connection to the makeup of your team can impact your enjoyment of Siege, but importantly, Siege itself does everything it can to ensure you're able to enjoy the game in spite of these variables.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">Being an always-online game, Siege also comes with it's fair share of minor annoyances that, while mostly unobtrusive, are still worth mentioning. Map rotation could be more consistent. Console players could use more in-game communication tools beyond the temporary marker icon. Matchmaking needs to be just as smooth on PC as it currently is on consoles. Purchasing and equipping new gear shouldn't require players to back out of matches. There needs to be an easier way to kick and report disruptive players.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Everything from the strength of your internet connection to the makeup of your team can impact your enjoyment of Siege, but importantly, Siege itself does everything it can to ensure you're able to enjoy the game in spite of these variables. Across all the hours I spent online, players were consistently cooperative and communicative, and to some degree, I have to credit Siege's tutorials and situations for adequately conveying how the game is meant to be played.</p><p style="">My experiences weren't always perfect, but when Siege works, there's nothing else like it. It's not designed to appeal to all players, and that's exactly what allows it to be something special. With so much strategic depth, those periods between firefights actually become some of the most rewarding, while firefights themselves are made all the more intense by the knowledge that you're fighting for your life, not just your kill/death ratio.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2015 16:28:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416324</guid><dc:creator>Scott Butterworth</dc:creator><media:content url="http://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1197/11970954/2973270-r6s-review2015_corridor_4k_1448831220.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /></item>
<item><title>Just Cause 3 Review</title><link>http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/just-cause-3-review/1900-6416323/</link><description><![CDATA[<p style=""><a href="http://www.gamespot.com/just-cause-3">Just Cause 3</a> makes no apologies for its outrageous nature. It's a power fantasy in every sense of the phrase, placing you in a world rife with destructible environments and giving you creative instruments with which to destroy them. There are intermittent technical problems, and scripted moments detract from the freedom found elsewhere, but in the end, Just Cause 3 provides a spectacular, explosive sandbox experience.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">The plot revolves around returning protagonist Rico Rodriguez, who's arrived in the fictional Republic of Medici during the height of Sebastiano Di Ravello's military dictatorship. The story here is forgettable, but delivers an effective invitation: dozens of military installations cover the world map, and it's your job to blow them up for the rebel forces.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Rodriguez himself is a mashup of masculine action stars and comic book characters, so it makes sense that I often felt like a superhero in his shoes. By supplying you with a wingsuit, parachute, and grappling hook, Just Cause 3 gives you an effective means of transportation, as well as a smooth, nuanced traversal system.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">There is a steep learning curve, but with practice, I was leaping from helicopters, gliding through enemy bases, and floating over farmland with ease. It's thrilling to leap from a cliff, free-fall for 10 seconds, grapple to a nearby rock, and use the momentum to launch back into the air with parachute deployed. Rico actually felt like a hero learning his new skillset. It's as if Avalanche Studios combined Batman, Spider-Man, and The Punisher, and thrust its creation into a vivid Mediterranean landscape.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1365/13658182/2807299-jc3_screenshot_chutevista1_13_1422545231.02.15_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2807299" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1280px"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1365/13658182/2807299-jc3_screenshot_chutevista1_13_1422545231.02.15_01.jpg"><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1365/13658182/2807299-jc3_screenshot_chutevista1_13_1422545231.02.15_01.jpg"></a><figcaption>For a place soon to be covered in explosions, Medici is gorgeous.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">What follows is a collision of spectacle and scale. Helicopters dot the sky. Explosions chain across the screen. Combining a parachute and grenade launcher transforms Rodriguez into a floating artillery battery from above. In a world teetering toward total destruction, Just Cause 3 grants you the tools to push it over the edge.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">The traditional grenades, remote mines, and numerous land, air, and sea vehicles are all on call in the rebel arsenal. Then there's the tether: this grappling hook modification attaches two separate objects, and flings them toward each other, often with hilarious results. Rodriguez can reel enemies toward explosive barrels, collapse watchtowers, and pull attack helicopters into a fiery end. It's a testament to this game's creativity that guns were my last resort.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">There's a sequence in Just Cause 3 in which a fleet of helicopters pursue you over a mountain range. In any other game, I may have resorted to the RPG slung across my back. But in keeping with this game's lack of convention, I grappled to the nearest attack chopper, pulled the pilot out, and assumed control in his place.</p><blockquote data-align="center" data-size="large"><p dir="ltr" style="">Just Cause 3 makes you feel like Batman, Spider-Man, and The Punisher combined.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">But that somehow still felt too normal. So I evacuated my helicopter mid-air, opened my wingsuit, glided toward another nearby enemy, and grappled to his chopper door. By repeating the process, I ditched helicopter after helicopter, sending both pilots and machines soaring into the mountain range below, all without firing a single shot.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">The game provided no hint to this approach. I just devised a plan and watched it unfold. Just Cause 3 doesn't nudge you in one direction or the other--it shows you the possibilities, and gets out of the way.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Like all of Just Cause 3's best moments, the tether encourages experimentation, rather than thoughtless reaction, and as the hours passed, the destruction remained creative and unpredictable. New domino reactions and car crashes were always on the horizon. It's a small mechanic, but its effects can be massive, and it encapsulates what makes Just Cause 3 so fun. Even now, after 30 hours in this idyllic sandbox, I'm sure I haven't seen every use for the tether.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">And just when it seems the well of experiments might be running dry, Avalanche Studios adds variety to proceedings. As you liberate new provinces from enemy hands, challenges pop up across the map, including vehicle races, machine gun score contests, and wingsuit dives. They're fun on their own, but they're also well worth pursuing. By completing these, you'll unlock new gear mods, which change the functions of certain items.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1365/13658182/2795962-jc2_screenshot_carstunting1_11_1418315491.12.2014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2795962" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1280px"><a href="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1365/13658182/2795962-jc2_screenshot_carstunting1_11_1418315491.12.2014.jpg"><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1365/13658182/2795962-jc2_screenshot_carstunting1_11_1418315491.12.2014.jpg"></a><figcaption>Much of the action takes place mid-air.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">While some of these are minor, such as increased grenade capacity or a nitrous boost for vehicles, others reveal dynamic new ways to experiment in Just Cause 3's sandbox.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Take the rocket boost mines, for example. Whereas previous iterations of the device just detonated at a chosen time, this modification sends objects careening into distant structures before exploding. I used this on cars numerous times, creating two-ton bombs that flew toward enemy fuel tanks with increased velocity after I dove from the driver’s seat.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">This cascading structure is what makes Just Cause 3 so great. There's a cadence to how you approach its world: outpost liberation leads to challenges, which leads to gear mods, which leads to experimentation. And more often than not, each tier of this formula is entertaining in itself. That each flows so well into the next makes the overall experience all the more rewarding. Just Cause 3 excels because it adds variety to the equation throughout, making destruction and mayhem entertaining far past the early hours.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">However, Just Cause 3 does deviate from its open-world freedom at times, and when it does, it falters. The scripted story missions progress the plot, but the actual gameplay involved is repetitive at best, and broken at worst.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr" style="">Despite its spectacle, Just Cause 3 is filled with bugs, bad AI, and other rough edges.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">The vast majority of these tasks are escort missions, in which you defend a plane, or boat, or caravan of jeeps. Protecting another character can be tiresome to begin with, and because their behavior is unpredictable and often unintelligent, I restarted checkpoints far more than felt fair. Halting progress because of my own mistakes is one thing, but when it was out of my hands, my patience grew thin.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Just Cause 3 is also filled with bugs and other rough edges. The parachute closed at random, cars disappeared while moving, and AI behavior made several story objectives impossible for a short time. One mission required me to steal a prototype combat tank from Di Ravello's forces, and extract it by boat to the hidden rebel base. However, the boat was too far from the dock for me to board it, and I had to reload the previous checkpoint. It repeated the same mistake twice more after that.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">For a game that places death front and center, it was often inconsistent with whether I should die. I'm happy Just Cause 3 is lenient with its falling damage--considering I'm in the sky more often than not--but I survived a 500-foot fall at one point, only to die from a shorter one soon thereafter. These mishaps would be easy to overlook if they didn't disrupt an otherwise fluid experience too often.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1365/13658182/2807308-jc3_screenshot_wingsuittown1_13_1422545274.02.15_09.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2807308" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1280px"><a href="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1365/13658182/2807308-jc3_screenshot_wingsuittown1_13_1422545274.02.15_09.jpg"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1365/13658182/2807308-jc3_screenshot_wingsuittown1_13_1422545274.02.15_09.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1365/13658182/2807308-jc3_screenshot_wingsuittown1_13_1422545274.02.15_09.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Late-game upgrades make traversal even smoother.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">When Just Cause 3 is consistent, however, it's a stunning display of cause and effect, as watchtowers topple into fuel tanks, which blow up nearby helicopters, which sail into oncoming vehicles. I often spent hours setting up outlandish chain reactions, or trying new gear mods, knowing full well I wasn't making any progress in the traditional sense. I was content to just sit back and marvel as it all happened.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">But there's a more thoughtful undercurrent as well. Despite the explosions and instant gratification throughout, Just Cause 3 also encourages experimentation and foresight, planning and careful approaches. The results are as rewarding as they are entertaining.</p><p dir="ltr" style=""><em>Editor's Note: The majority of our time with Just Cause 3 was spent with the PC version, followed by several hours on both PS4 and Xbox One. Based on the review builds provided, the game performed better on PC, with higher and more stable frame rates, fewer bugs, and better looking environments. However, the problems did not affect the overall experience enough to impact individual scores.</em></p><p style=""> </p>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov 2015 16:01:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416323</guid><dc:creator>Mike Mahardy</dc:creator><media:content url="http://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1365/13658182/2807306-jc3_screenshot_planejack1_13_1422545263.02.15_07.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /></item>
<item><title>Xenoblade Chronicles X Review</title><link>http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review/1900-6416322/</link><description><![CDATA[<p style="">Of all the open-world games to come out this year, Xenoblade Chronicles X may be the most formidable. It is a truly enormous game, both in scale and scope, with towering animals and rock formations stretching as far as the eye can see. Even after as many as 60 hours, X continues to provide taller mountains to climb, and stronger opponents to topple, with no end of new challenges in sight.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">At the same time, X is a long RPG with a thin story and repetitive, lifeless characters. You hear the same jokes over and over again, and endure drawn-out cutscenes with little to no emotional payoff. Like so many Japanese-made RPGs, X's serious moments are often undermined by the presence of a cute and cuddly sidekick. When you aren't wincing at the sight of Tatsu--the game's stuffed animal of choice--you may instead be reeling from the soundtrack, which is dotted with low-rent tracks that make you reach for the mute button.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">These are reasons enough to walk away from most games, but X isn't most games. By offering a steady stream of challenges that take you to fantastic places and put you into fights at the feet of giants, X has no problem enticing you back for more. It's a feat of large-scale game design that would be impressive on any console or computer, let alone on the modestly-powered Wii U, and getting the chance to explore and fight in a world as impressive as this one is worth enduring a few annoyances along the way.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Your journey begins when you wake up in a life pod on Planet Mira. A spaceship that escaped from Earth crash landed here after just avoiding complete destruction in an alien conflict, and the few humans who remain are left to fight for the survival of species. As a member of Blade--the military organization in charge of scouring Mira and defending humanity--your primary goal is to locate the invaluable pod known as the Lifehold. If Blade can secure it, the safety of your colony--New Los Angeles---will be ensured. If it falls into the wrong hands, your time is up.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2972444-xeno2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2972444" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1280px"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2972444-xeno2.jpg"><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2972444-xeno2.jpg"></a><figcaption>Healing your characters requires you to react to QTEs, which can be difficult during heated battles.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Apart from the odd name given to your colony, X's story isn't memorable, save for a couple twists. However, the context provides an excellent framework for exploration and combat. You play the part of a soldier on the frontier who treks across Mira, an ancient land whose features suggest a storied and chaotic past and whose inhabitants regularly dwarf your squad of explorers. Massive, electric creatures hover over land and sea, and spiders the size of small houses march across plains. Dinosaurs and mammals with feet taller than your character cast huge shadows over the land, and while I felt intimidated the first time I saw one of these monsters, I dreamt of the day that I would be strong enough to take one on in a fight. With enough time and energy, that dream can become a reality.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">While some animals are content to leave you be, others are aggressive and will attack on-sight. You defend yourself and your team of three AI controlled soldiers in real-time combat which, for the most part, is a smooth and exciting experience. Every character has a melee weapon, a ranged weapon, and, depending on their class, a selection of offensive and defensive Arts (read: abilities) at their disposal. You earn new Arts when you level-up, and special class-based skills unlock every time you earn a new rank, so you have a steady stream of new abilities to experiment with as your adventure continues. Once you begin to identify skills that suit your play-style, you can invest a third measure of experience--battle points--to soup up your favorite moves and craft a unique fighting style.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr" style="">After dozens of hours exploring on foot, the moment you jump into the pilot's seat of a Skell is an awakening.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">Instead of casting healing spells or using consumable items to patch up wounded warriors, you rely on a QTE system, which is triggered by a complex series of events in battle. Something as basic as healing, in a game where combat is central to the experience, should be made clear from the start, but you're left to decipher a complex system, known as Soul Voices, where you assign automatic actions to very specific battle conditions. As much as you might want to, you can't totally control the tide of battle, so you pick and choose variables, praying that when the going gets tough, you've assigned a suitable automatic event to save the day. If this sounds confusing, it's because it is. While it's rare that you're left without an opportunity to recover some health, there are times when you wish that you could take matters into your own hands.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">X does a poor job of explaining things in general, and you will spend a lot of time with the in-game manual, poring over pages in search of information. X allows you to dive deep into character progression and resource management but, without proper guidance, you will undoubtedly get lost. This may sideline more advanced pursuits in order to continue exploring and fighting--if only because those activities come so naturally.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2972467-xeno6" data-ref-id="1300-2972467" data-ratio="0.56041666666667" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1280px"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2972467-xeno6"><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2972467-xeno6"></a><figcaption>You always remember your first Skell.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Story missions set a good pace for exploration and skill development, and the conclusion of each chapter grants you access to a new series of rewarding side quests. It's unfortunate, however, that you can't organically weave your way from one chapter to the next. Each story mission comes with a set of prerequisites, such as surveying a percentage of Mira, or, collecting a certain number of items from the wild. Exploring Mira isn't big ask, because it's just another excuse to dive headlong into its captivating wilderness, but fetch quests aren't as simple as retrieving items from fixed locations; the items you have to collect appear at random, be it from enemies or in the wild. Sometimes you find exactly what you need in a matter of minutes, but on a bad day, it can take hours.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Though progression sometimes slows to a halt because you're required to complete a seemingly unimportant mission, grinding in any form can be made easier by recruiting other players' characters. By visiting a terminal at your base, you can spend in-game currency to hire avatars that people have shared online. While this isn't something you have to do often, hiring a high-level character can make it easy to grind for experience, or to venture into dangerous territory. Even though I couldn't chat with her and strategize, I still loved that I was able to recruit a level 60 character named Samus and watch her tear through a swarm of aliens when I needed it most.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr" style="">Xenoblade Chronicles X is a feat of large-scale game design that would be impressive on any console or computer, let alone on the modestly-powered Wii U.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">Exploration and missions are an important part of being a Blade soldier, but you are also responsible for setting up a network of devices to mine Mira's resources and gather information. Miranium is a key resource that can be invested in weapons and armor manufacturers in order to unlock powerful exotic gear. From your humble beginnings in kneepads and wrist guards, you slowly blossom into a skilled warrior who's decked out in the finest ornate alien equipment, and it’s all because of your efforts as an explorer. X has no shortage of wondrous sights to behold, but it also incentivizes you in other, more beneficial ways.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Just when you start to think that you've exhausted your hunt for new gear, you unlock Skells, which are X's giant bipedal robots. After dozens of hours exploring on foot, the moment you jump into the pilot's seat of a Skell is an awakening. It can transform into a vehicle on-the-fly, allowing you to traverse large swaths of land in a flash. You are considerably more powerful in combat, too, and you finally have a fighting chance against monsters that previously seemed out of your league thanks to your newfound beam saber and missile launchers. You can also trample over smaller enemies without skipping a beat; small being relative, of course, as practically everything in X is bigger than you when on-foot.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2972721-review_60fps.00_05_31_48.still003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2972721" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="640" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 640px"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2972721-review_60fps.00_05_31_48.still003.jpg"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1406/14063904/2972721-review_60fps.00_05_31_48.still003.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1406/14063904/2972721-review_60fps.00_05_31_48.still003.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Where we're going, we don't need roads.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Your first Skell is just the beginning--there are multiple models to buy, each with over a dozen parts to customize and upgrade.

<item><title>The Crew: Wild Run Edition Review</title><link>http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-crew-wild-run-edition-review/1900-6416321/</link><description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" style="">Ambition has never been an issue for The Crew. When it launched last December, Ubisoft's open world "carPG" attempted to provide players the opportunity to drive across the entire continental United States with a full squad of friends, competing in a wide variety of events like traditional circuit races and chaotic desert raids along the way. Unfortunately, much of the game's potential went unrealized. The world map--while indeed massive--led to hours of empty commuting through bland environments. The online multiplayer's myriad technical issues crippled its cooperative aspirations. Even the driving felt too floaty to offer much satisfaction. The Crew, in short, was disappointing, especially given how appealing its original aims were.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Now, just shy of 12 months later, Ubisoft has released the Wild Run expansion, and like the original, it bursts with ambition, building out the base game with motorcycles, monster trucks, drag and drift builds, new licensed vehicles, dynamic weather, visual upgrades throughout, game-wide physics adjustments, and a massive on-going online competition called The Summit. With such an impressive suite of new opportunities on offer, it's painful to report execution once again undermines ambition.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2966920-tcwr_launch_screenshot_bikevsbike_1447699501.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2966920" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2966920-tcwr_launch_screenshot_bikevsbike_1447699501.jpg"><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1197/11970954/2966920-tcwr_launch_screenshot_bikevsbike_1447699501.jpg"></a><figcaption>Wild Run exists as both DLC and a total package disc that includes the full game and a Wild Run download code.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Admirably, several of Wild Run's broadest updates are available to all players, not just those who purchase the expansion (if you already own The Crew, your game most likely updated itself last week). Chief among these: upgraded graphics and physics, as well as all new weather effects. And while each objectively improves its previous iteration, The Crew as a whole continues to trail behind the competition. Take the dynamic weather: During the dozen or so hours I spent driving around Wild Run, I encountered only moderate rain. That's an improvement over the complete absence of weather in the base game, but honestly, it's hard to get excited about some underwhelming white dots that vaguely resemble rain drops refracting headlight beams.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">To the game's credit, wet streets noticeably change your cars' traction thanks to the improved physics and handling. Every vehicle now reacts more believably to user inputs, making the simple act of driving a bit more enjoyable than it had been previously. This update doesn't resolve every issue, though. At times, it still feels like cars aren't even touching the road but rather gliding on top of it. Most of the subtle sounds and visual cues that make games like Forza satisfying remain absent here. Same can be said of the visuals: Issues like assets that pop into existence as you approach them have been resolved, but textures are still bland and uniform while objects like pedestrian cars still feel oddly boxy and unrealistic. The Crew finally looks like a current-gen game, but it's still deeply unimpressive compared to something like Need For Speed.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1365/13658182/2917751-tcwr_screen_freedrive_challenges_gc_150805_10am_1438627009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2917751" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1365/13658182/2917751-tcwr_screen_freedrive_challenges_gc_150805_10am_1438627009.jpg"><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1365/13658182/2917751-tcwr_screen_freedrive_challenges_gc_150805_10am_1438627009.jpg"></a><figcaption>All Crew players receive updated physics, graphics, and weather, but if you want bikes and dragsters, you'll have to buy Wild Run.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">You could argue The Crew's dated graphics are an inevitable consequence of its incredible scope, but its open world is still more of a nuisance than an asset, especially for new players who can't fast travel to undiscovered areas. Wild Run attempts to assuage the potential tedium of cross-country commuting by introducing FreeDrive Stunts, an anywhere, anytime mode that throws randomized goals at players. On-demand mini-objectives are a fine idea, but the objectives themselves--drive on the wrong side of the road for 800 yards, near-miss 15 vehicles, and so on--are forgettable at best and impossible at worst. How can you jump a certain distance within a time limit when there are no ramps around? Similarly, FreeDrive Challenge--which allows players to quickly drop checkpoints on the world map to create ad-hoc events--is an amazing idea that falls apart in practice because it's only available while players are participating in in a co-op Crew. If you're playing solo or can't keep random internet players around long enough, you'll never see a FreeDrive Challenge in action.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Fortunately, Wild Run's new vehicle specs prove a bit more reliable--and yes, I do mean "specs." For the uninitiated, The Crew allows players to select a variety of tuning profiles that automatically equip your chosen vehicle with everything it needs to rip up the streets or the race track or the untamed wilderness. Wild Run introduces three new specs that can be added to many of the game's existing cars: drift, drag, and monster truck. Drift and drag cars are so unruly--fishtailing wildly in every direction--they're nearly impossible to use outside of the extremely limited number of events specifically designed for those specs. Within those events, however, they work well and add even more variety to The Crew's already impressive collection of race types.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Drag events are simple but satisfying: Players must rev their engines to fill a meter to exactly the right level, then match prompts while accelerating and shifting. There's not much to it, but if you're looking to test your timing and push The Crew's speed limit, you now have a new best option. Drift events, as you might expect, ask players to rack up points by chaining drifts together within a time limit. Thankfully, the scoring system is a bit more generous than the comparable Need For Speed, but the handling never quite clicked for me, too loose and fiddly to feel truly satisfying. Overall, drift trials deepen The Crew but may not fully scratch your drift itch.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2966918-tcwr_launch_render_maserati_granturismo_s_racing_1447699659.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2966918" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2966918-tcwr_launch_render_maserati_granturismo_s_racing_1447699659.jpg"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1197/11970954/2966918-tcwr_launch_render_maserati_granturismo_s_racing_1447699659.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1197/11970954/2966918-tcwr_launch_render_maserati_granturismo_s_racing_1447699659.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Summit adds some new areas, but most events utilize previously existing portions of the world.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Monster trucks and the newly added motorcycles, on the other hand, are a total blast no matter where you drive them. As you might expect, motorcycles are fast and nimble, which presents a welcome contrast to many of The Crew's more sluggish vehicles. The real winners here, though, are the monster trucks. It's hard not to love hilariously oversized tires that let you roll over just about everything in your path, especially when they're attached to something like a Fiat. Monster trucks also bring with them massive Trackmania-style arenas, which are basically big, ridiculous skateparks for monster trucks. Not much can match the joy of pulling double backflips on a half-pipe in a Ford Raptor.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Unfortunately, I was only able to find monster truck events within the new month-long, Burning-Man-meets-autosports competition called The Summit. Given that the competition consists of weekly qualifiers leading up to a final Summit at the end of each month, we'll get just one new monster truck event per week at this current pace. Thankfully, the Summit offers plenty of other options that, while not as enjoyable as its monster trucks, give players a tangible reason to consistently return to The Crew. You'll find drift and drag events, of course, as well as time trials and circuit races, but you can also engage in unique PvP events like Blitz Brawl, which challenges players to race between semi-randomly appearing zones and hold each zone until the next one appears. Each leg of the Summit offers six or seven unique events, which a healthy enough number to allow its evolving structure and leaderboard-driven competitiveness take root.</p><p style="">In spite of all this new content, many of the base game's frustrations persist. The UI is still an unintuitive mess, the story is still laughably bad and impossible for new players to avoid, and finding players to join my Crew frequently took far too long. And while the driving mechanics and general visuals have undoubtedly improved, they still haven't caught up to other, better racing games like Forza and Need For Speed. As a result, The Crew as a whole remains a lackluster experience, even with its monster truck half-pipes.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Nov 2015 17:55:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416321</guid><dc:creator>Scott Butterworth</dc:creator><media:content url="http://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1197/11970954/2966922-tcwr_launch_screenshot_monster_arena_1447699505.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /></item>
<item><title>Skyshine&#039;s Bedlam Review</title><link>http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/skyshines-bedlam-review/1900-6416320/</link><description><![CDATA[<p style="">If you took my favorite things and threw them in a blender it would come out looking like Skyshine’s Bedlam. Its blend of <em>Mad Max's</em> aesthetic, turn-based strategy combat, and roguelike trappings made me think I’d found the perfect game for me. But just like love at first sight, once I got to know Bedlam a little better, I realized that looks can be deceiving.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">In Skyshine’s Bedlam, you helm a vehicle known as the Dozer. The minute story details change from playthrough to playthrough because of the procedurally-generated nature of the game, but the main goal is to flee your home of Bysantine and drive you and your passengers to the Aztec City--Bysantine is suffering under the tyranny of a crazed warlord, King Viscera (no, not the ex-WWE wrestler). Along the way, you're stopped by wanderers, hostile factions, and other events and people that prevent you from just making a bee-line to your destination.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2970471-screenshot-0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2970471" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2970471-screenshot-0.jpg"><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2970471-screenshot-0.jpg"></a><figcaption>Great artwork carries an otherwise shallow experience.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Combat is a turn-based affair where you fight groups of marauders, mutants, and cyborgs. Your entire party can perform two actions per turn, which can be used to either move around, or to attack an enemy; for example, if you move one character and attack with another, your team's turn is over. This is far too restrictive in practice, and you often feel like there are only two strategies: move your character out of harm's way, or kill one enemy and have one of your characters die because you couldn't get them to safety.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Simple tactics, like using a shotgun to knockback enemies into range of another character's attack, feel rewarding, but those moments are fleeting. There's not much strategic depth, and other than move distance, attack range, and damage, there's little else that distinguishes one character class from another, and little else to toy with during combat. I ultimately felt lucky--not accomplished--when I was victorious.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">The comic book-like presentation is great, and there's some enjoyable animations to behold, especially during combat. Killing an enemy with certain weapons, such as puke or a shotgun, causes them to crumble into a pile of bones. Characters perform finishing move animations if you kill an enemy point blank, like kicking them in the balls and delivering an elbow drop. These are pretty satisfying to watch and make some of the shots look absolutely devastating.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2970473-screenshot-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2970473" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2970473-screenshot-2.jpg"><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2970473-screenshot-2.jpg"></a><figcaption>"That's not a knife. THIS is a knife."</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">The Dozer plays a major role in the world-traversing part of the game. During these segments, you click on icons to move around a randomly-generated map at the cost of food and fuel; the icons on the map will deliver tidbits of story through text. Sometimes you end up in a fight, sometimes you find some resources, and sometimes nothing will happen. Unfortunately, the variety of text that appears on the map is low, as I found text repeating itself quite early on, which pulled me out of the story.</p><blockquote data-size="medium" data-align="right"><p dir="ltr" style="">There are times when they're unhappy, scared, or in need of a breath of fresh air, but it doesn’t delve deeper than that and I really wish Bedlam would give me a good reason to care about them. You rarely get the feeling that you're harboring living, breathing humans.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">In addition to providing transportation, the Dozer can be used to heal teammates, turn them invisible, and to attack enemies. These abilities don’t count as an action, but they require power cells--a rather limited resource. These attacks deliver a devastating blow to your enemies, but because of the high resource cost--due to the rarity of power cells--I rarely used the Dozer for anything but healing my group.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">In the context of the story, your passengers are precious cargo, which you can lose if you're unlucky, or play poorly. There are times when they're unhappy, scared, or in need of a breath of fresh air, but it doesn’t delve deeper than that and I really wish Bedlam would give me a good reason to care about them. You rarely get the feeling that you're harboring living, breathing humans. Though the game ends if you run out of passengers, they're oddly plentiful, to the point that it's a no-brainer to give some of them up in trade to refuel the Dozer. As long as you make it to Aztec City, you are rewarded with new soldiers, regardless of how well you treated your crew.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2970474-screenshot-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2970474" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2970474-screenshot-3.jpg"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2970474-screenshot-3.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2970474-screenshot-3.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Dozer: your home away from home.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Defeating all of the hostile factions--Marauders, Mutants, Cyborgs, and Rogue A.I.-- allows you to unlock new factions and their respective Dozers. Each faction has its own unique abilities and stats; Rogue A.I. can teleport, while the Cyborgs can go invisible, allowing them to avoid getting hit for a turn. The big problem is that it’s not clear how you defeat a faction; it requires luck and patience, as finding the events that lead to unlocking a Dozer is seemingly random.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr" style="">Not being able to make meaningful, permanent progress is ultimately its biggest flaw, and when something so crucial is missing, it’s hard to recommend.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">You occasionally run into Elites during your travels, which are significantly larger and stronger characters than the average wastelander. With a greater amount of health and strength, they're tough, but they will join your ranks if you can beat them. It feels like a special event when they appear, and I always make a beeline toward them when they show up, dreaming of my powerful new recruit. Favorites include a lizard-mutant that pukes an acid-like substance and a giant wildman with a triple-barrelled shotgun that shoots incendiary ammo.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2970472-screenshot-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2970472" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2970472-screenshot-1.jpg"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2970472-screenshot-1.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2970472-screenshot-1.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>"It was definitely something I ate."</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Normally, you organically find Elites during your journey, but in the new Challenge mode, you start with a random crew of Elites and stronger-than-average soldiers from the get-go. Here, your goal is reversed: you travel from Aztec City to Byzantine, though King Viscera and factions are still on high alert, now with increased health and strength. This puts you past the stage of leveling up your crew and puts you right into the middle of hard-hitting combat. This is initially thrilling, but it can also be frustratingly difficult; you often feel forced to focus all of your resources on boss characters, which often leaves you empty handed, and ill-prepared to face the rest of your opponents.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Skyshine’s Bedlam has some good moments, but the story is devoid interesting or layered tales. The experience is largely defined by chasing simple goals while enduring repetitive dialogue and narrative beats along the way. Combat feels good enough, but there's not much to it, and little to strive for. Not being able to make meaningful, permanent progress is ultimately Skyshine's Bedlam's biggest flaw, and when something so crucial is missing, it’s hard to recommend. There is some fun to be had, but Skyshine's Bedlam ultimately mirrors the reality it depicts. You can survive hardships, but only if you struggle through them.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Nov 2015 14:29:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416320</guid><dc:creator>Mat Paget</dc:creator><media:content url="http://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1406/14063904/2970467-shinysky.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /></item>
<item><title>Minecraft: Story Mode Episode Three--The Last Place You Look Review</title><link>http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/minecraft-story-mode-episode-three-the-last-place-/1900-6416319/</link><description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" style="">(There be story spoilers below. Proceed at your own risk!)</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Endermen were already the creepiest creatures in the world of Minecraft, but the latest episode in Telltale's narrative take on the hit game makes them close to something truly disturbing. In Minecraft Story Mode: The Last Place You Look, these enigmatic creatures take center stage, proving to be a scary antagonists in several key sequences. Their use here is emblematic of Minecraft Story Mode's clever approach to creating a narrative within the wider world of Minecraft; there's a real reverence for the original game on display, and while the adherence may be strict, the way the many disparate pieces of Minecraft have been put together in service of an increasingly compelling story continues to be engaging.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">This third episode of Minecraft Story Mode features the same propulsive energy as the second, with the added bonus of also being the most thrilling narratively. By the end of this short chapter, the stakes for the entire series have not only been elevated but, in many ways, completely reset as well.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Episode Two ended on a somewhat lame cliffhanger, and it's not long before our group of heroes manage to find their way out of their predicament by doing the very Minecraft thing of just digging straight down. From here, The Last Place You Look moves briskly, skipping from an exciting opening sequence set within a gigantic mob grinder filled with enemies to a visit to the End to find the last missing member of the Order of the Stone (voiced by the always excellent John Hodgman).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/225/2256286/2969973-0792886943-Commo.png" data-ref-id="1300-2969973" style="width: 1024px" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="1024" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/225/2256286/2969973-0792886943-Commo.png"><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/225/2256286/2969973-0792886943-Commo.png"></a><figcaption>Whatever you do, don't look at the Enderman!</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Along the way, some of the series' key relationships and plot lines are moved forward, some quite significantly. Lukas' growing unease threatens to boil over, your character's relationship with your Wither sickness-infected party member--whose identity is dependant on a choice you made in Episode 1--gains complexity, and the team's overarching goal of coming up with an explosive solution to defeat the gigantic Wither destroying the world comes to a head.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Narratively, this is the most complex Minecraft Story Mode has been so far, which is a welcome change from the simpler, black-and-white shading of previous episodes. It's also the most emotionally wrought. Several scenes were quite affecting, and was surprising given the series' fairly light and jovial tone so far. While Episode Three is still light years away from the rawness of Telltale's take on The Walking Dead or Game of Thrones, younger players may need some guidance with some of the heavier situations that occur.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/225/2256286/2969975-0356299631-Commo.png" data-ref-id="1300-2969975" style="width: 320px" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="320" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/225/2256286/2969975-0356299631-Commo.png"><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_small/225/2256286/2969975-0356299631-Commo.png"></a></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Episode Three also ramps up the tension, and it's all thanks to those creepy Endermen. Their cold stares, propensity to teleport suddenly, and open- jawed screams are used to great effect here. All of the sequences where hero Jesse and the crew having to contend with Endermen are clear highlights.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">It all leads to a conclusion where, while not completely surprising in its details, is still presented in an exciting, involving way that makes you feel--almost--like resolution is close at hand. There's also a last-gasp character revelation that makes for Story Mode's first truly intriguing cliffhanger. The ending made me long for that next episode to come quicker.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">As always, Minecraft Story Mode's love for the source material shines through, in touches both large and small. Seeing a gigantic, complex grinder in action made me regret never having the time or skills to make a machine like that in my own Minecraft game, while little character touches (like everyone lowering their eyes so as not to attract Endermen attention) shows off the series' consistently wonderful attention to detail.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/225/2256286/2969974-4707059850-Commo.png" data-ref-id="1300-2969974" style="width: 1024px" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="1024" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/225/2256286/2969974-4707059850-Commo.png"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/225/2256286/2969974-4707059850-Commo.png" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/225/2256286/2969974-4707059850-Commo.png"></noscript></a><figcaption>OK, so there may be trouble brewing here.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Minecraft Story Mode's third episode is the best so far, weaving action and story in a tight, focused package. This is another short episode (my first playthrough clocked in at less than 90 minutes), which makes Story Mode a little on the brief side compared to recent Telltale offerings. But that brevity is my biggest complaint, which, if you look at it from the most charitable view, means the game never outstayed its welcome. Story Mode remains a great experience--especially if you're playing with younger fans of Minecraft--and my anticipation for the next episode remains high.</p><p style=""> </p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Nov 2015 09:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416319</guid><dc:creator>Randolph Ramsay</dc:creator><media:content url="http://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1197/11970954/2938344-mcsm_beta_jesse_variations.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /></item>
<item><title>Anno 2205 Review</title><link>http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/anno-2205-review/1900-6416317/</link><description><![CDATA[<p style="">Imagine a future where global warming has melted the Earth's ice sheets, and all that's left is a fractured society desperate to pick up the pieces and build anew on the few islands that remain. This is the setting of Anno 2205, a game where you side with one of two competing corporations to rebuild civilization, and eventually, construct a fusion reactor on the moon for a limitless resource of clean energy.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Thankfully, humanity doesn't have to start from scratch. During your campaign, you have access to bits and pieces of advanced technology leftover from Earth's better years, but there's still a lot that needs to be rebuilt. That's where you come in. You're responsible for constructing new houses, roads, and factories, plus all the logistical systems that are required to support and transport all of your goods.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Like most city-builders, construction is handled with a straightforward system of dragging and dropping elements from a menu onto a map. Anno 2205 makes construction a simple affair; even more so than usual. It adapts the series' mechanics to work within the constraints of a flooded, land-starved Earth, allowing you to tack modules onto existing properties to boost resource production, rather than having to construct entirely new buildings that eat up your ever-valuable real estate. Unlike most games in the genre to force you to permanently commit to decisions, you can also reposition elements after they're built in Anno 2205, which makes it easy to react when things don't go according to your original plan.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">You can eventually take on bigger construction projects that unlock new areas, including arctic settlements, additional islands, and, yes, the Moon. These projects require huge chunks of resources, however, and given that you earn funds at fixed intervals while playing, you have to do an awful lot of waiting before you can enjoy building and managing greater expansions. Anno 2205 accounts for this by giving you optional, secondary objectives to help pass the time.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Every so often a terrorist organization launches attacks on supply lines and climate regulators. When they do, you can engage in a military mission to capture and control the objectives in question. While on these excursions, you continue to earn resources back home, and your bank account--provided you were running with a budget surplus when you started the mission--will continue to grow. If you're in the red, though, you'll often come back to find that you need an emergency loan to keep your corporation afloat.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2969845-anno_2205_8-100625323-orig.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2969845" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2969845-anno_2205_8-100625323-orig.jpg"><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2969845-anno_2205_8-100625323-orig.jpg"></a><figcaption>You can complete additional military missions to help pad out the time you spend building up your cities.   </figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Unfortunately, Anno 2205 isn't a very challenging game. Every resource is inexhaustible, or close to it, and any city you build will stay stable for quite a long while. All you need is enough cash to lay down a ton of houses to attract workers, then build up factories, upgrade your workers, upgrade the factories, and repeat. Once you've got that cadence down, not only do missions become trivial, but the campaign flies by in a couple of hours.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Military missions aren't much better. Even on higher difficulties, you can survive by employing the most basic tactics. As you move through a map, you regularly discover and acquire new tools in the form of missiles, mines, and support craft, and as a result, your over-powered military rarely faces an enemy it can't beat. It's a shame that Anno 2205 is so easy to figure out, because alternating between two distinct modes creates an enjoyable dynamic at first. But after a while, the lack of challenge in either mode leads to boredom, and you begin to dwell on how shallow each experience is in isolation.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">If anything is the killer here, it's how short the campaign is overall. I finished my first run after five hours, and subsequent playthroughs went by even faster. City building games have always been about maintaining balance. Tweak this thing here, another thing there, and wait to see if the effect was what you expected or needed. In Anno 2205, the rules and processes have been streamlined so much that you're robbed of this challenge. Cities' behavior are so predictable that it's far too easy to build everything you need and wait for everything to work itself out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2969846-anno+2205+preview2015-11-12-11-1-28.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2969846" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2969846-anno+2205+preview2015-11-12-11-1-28.jpg"><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2969846-anno+2205+preview2015-11-12-11-1-28.jpg"></a><figcaption>Side missions are a big part of Anno 2205, you can pick up extra resources and special buildings by paying attention to your neighbors.   </figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Balance issues aside, Anno 2205 has technical peculiarities that leave a bad taste in your mouth, too. It constantly simulates activities across multiple settlements in the background, but it takes a while for the game to load maps when you switch from one to the other. When planning out coordinated expansions that require two sets of resources from distant locations, you need to endure these frustratingly long loading times as you repeatedly shift your view from one map to the other. It's not game-breaking, but its a regular annoyance that impedes on your enjoyment.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">My machine is about as top-of-the-line as they come, and I also noticed some nasty frame-rate dips after a couple of hours that, while not making the game unplayable by any means, made it obnoxious to wrestle with. Adjusting graphical settings had unpredictable effects on the game's performance, making optimization a tricky affair overall.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">It's a shame that Anno 2205 takes the game so far into the future and does so little of substance with that premise. Not much has changed from Anno 2070, and what has is almost always worse. Anno 2205 still has a sturdy core of satisfying city planning and construction, but so much has been cut out as to make the game barely worth playing at all.</p><p style=""> </p>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2015 14:20:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416317</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Starkey</dc:creator><media:content url="http://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1406/14063904/2969785-anno.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /></item>
<item><title>Bloodborne: The Old Hunters Review</title><link>http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bloodborne-the-old-hunters-review/1900-6416316/</link><description><![CDATA[<p style="">The remaining humans in Bloodborne’s dead city of Yharnam think you’re making a mistake to even consider this new adventure. When you talk to them, they say that there’s nothing here for you, that it’s a nightmare. They’re incorrect on both counts. As an expansion that is a couple of areas and one boss fight short of being robust by add-on standards, The Old Hunters still has a good deal of tests for hardened Bloodborne and Souls enthusiasts. And no, the re-imagining of this Gothic urban landscape isn’t a nightmare--it’s a hellscape.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">The Old Hunters is replete with difficult encounters, especially against hunters and fearsome bosses. The enemies that lurk along Yharnam's dark pathways are as ruthless as any you would find in the main game. Many approach you with heightened bloodlust and fearless aggression, driving the point home that you are unwelcome.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Conversely, the return of Bloodborne’s sublime combat makes The Old Hunters immensely inviting. Every encounter demands thoughtfulness and dexterity, an experience all the more satisfying when you learn how to be swift and efficient with your actions. It means waiting for chances to attack and using patience through defensive dodge maneuvers. There’s added depth in the Rally system that was also available in the main game, where lost health can be regained through assertive offense, which encourages many thrilling close quarter duels.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">The new bosses here are a great complement to those from the main game, and they're more imaginative than what you can find in the chalice dungeons, too. They bring unexpected tactics to fights, making it hard to rely on your existing strategies. A couple of foes, such as the grossly deformed Ludwig, fight back against tried-and-true tactics such as rolling towards your opponent, so don't be surprised if they body slam you when you least expect it. Despite the somewhat familiar world and rules, The Old Hunters isn't short on surprises, even beyond boss fights. There are more than enough jump scares to make you yell at your TV and environmental traps that will make you feel like a complete imbecile if you have a propensity for leaping before looking.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2969404-0001+%284%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-2969404" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2969404-0001+%284%29.png"><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2969404-0001+%284%29.jpg"></a><figcaption>The new roster of bosses are full of surprises.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Equally engrossing are the mysteries borne from the myriad riddles hidden in conversations and cutscenes. Even after vanquishing every foe at least once, there’s very little one can deduce regarding the history of the hunters, let alone the reasons why some cooperate with you while others simply want you dead. The many new items included in The Old Hunters add to the overall lore with cryptic inscriptions, too. If you love the backstory, there’s value in reading the history of an item as unassuming as the Constable’s Trousers. Then there’s the Beasthunter Saif, a predecessor of the Saw Cleaver that affirms the events in The Old Hunters preceded those in Bloodborne proper, adding another unexpected layer to Yharnam's mysterious past.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr" style="">Despite the somewhat familiar world and rules, The Old Hunters isn't short on surprises.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">Like many of the other weapons in this expansion, the Saif’s base stats don't deviate far from the arms in the main game. Same goes for the Fist of Gratia, a crude hunk of iron that effectively functions as a brass knuckle in the ranged weapon slot. While the Saif essentially functions like the Saw Cleaver, you’ll find nuance in the speed of the combos, with your hunter’s arm stretching a bit further with each swing compared to the immediacy of the attack from the Saw Cleaver. Alternatively, you can now wield the Whirligig Saw, a deadly pizza cutter that attaches to an almost equally lethal bent staff. Simon’s Bowblade, a sword that transforms into a bow, is an inspired piece of work even if its concept is more impressive than its application in battle, as it’s one of the tougher weapons to master.. Bloodborne reaches peak From Software fan service with the Holy Moonlight Sword, a large blade that has seen action in the studio's other titles from Otogi to Armored Core. Aside from being viable alternatives to the flagship weapons, it’s intriguing to see these new tools work in action even if some do not cater to your specific play style.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2969407-0003+%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2969407" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2969407-0003+%283%29.jpg"><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2969407-0003+%283%29.jpg"></a><figcaption>The much hated crows return, hiding in plain sight. </figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">For as disturbing and depressing as Yharnam is in Bloodborne, it felt like the dark city still had a chance at redemption. The version of this city in The Old Hunters is beyond salvation. All the familiar paths are now covered in what appears to be hardened dough, with fingerprint-like lines and ridges. Countless gallons of blood drench the lower areas, leaving you to wonder how in this city managed to rid itself of these bulbous mounds and red pools before the events of the main game. This alien landscape makes this expansion feel fresh, despite the familiarity of the towering landmarks that make up Yharnam’s skyline.</p><blockquote data-align="center" data-size="large"><p dir="ltr" style="">The Old Hunters is Bloodborne from another time and place, and with more difficult bosses and confounding stories to unravel.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">Knowledge of the full game’s maps and shortcuts are of no value here and that’s okay. Figuring out a new locale is one of Bloodborne’s many pleasures. To find the opposite side of a locked gate, thereby revealing a shortcut to a previously visited area is also immensely gratifying. It’s a fitting reward for vanquishing the last few dozen foes that hindered your journey to that gate. These exploration-driven rewards are certainly present in The Old Hunters.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2969408-0002+%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2969408" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2969408-0002+%282%29.jpg"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2969408-0002+%282%29.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2969408-0002+%282%29.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Choosing between familiar blade types and more imaginative weapons is a fun problem to have. </figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">With optional companions, this unfriendly world becomes slightly less hostile. An NPC hunter is an adequate contributor in battle, distracting bosses and taking off small chunks off the enemy’s health in the process. You can return the favor by getting the opponent’s attention, thereby giving your companion a chance to heal. The AI can be an asset but given their inconsistent behavior and the inability to give them directions, there’s more profit to be found in allying with players. Speaking of co-op, the League serves as a substantial addition to Bloodborne’s Oath factions. Compared to passive incentives to joining the Executioners or the Vilebloods in the original game, the League is more goal-oriented, encouraging co-op play while also bringing a performance-based leaderboard into Bloodborne.</p><p style="">There’s beauty in both success and failure in Bloodborne. A one-second lapse in concentration can place you at the receiving end of a fatal combo but if you can maintain a persistent presence of mind, a triple-digit killstreak is not unheard of. Being tested by new foes in these new lands is an unquestionable joy, as is the ability to bring these newfound armaments and treasures into the main game. The Old Hunters is Bloodborne from another time and place, and with more difficult bosses and confounding stories to unravel, it's a fitting complement to the original, gruesome adventure.</p><p style=""> </p>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2015 07:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416316</guid><dc:creator>Miguel Concepcion</dc:creator><media:content url="http://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1406/14063904/2969399-oldhunters.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /></item>
<item><title>Undertale Review</title><link>http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/undertale-review/1900-6416315/</link><description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" style="">Undertale's opening cinematic hints at a cliche RPG where you awake in a mysterious world and embark on a journey in hopes of returning to your normal life. Despite the familiar premise, you quickly discover that looks can be deceiving. While many games can take a heavy-handed approach to teaching you the basics, Undertale does so in a way that not only introduces you to the tone of the game, but teaches you not to accept anything at face value. The first character you meet compels you to play nice, but as the cheerful music turns to sinister laughter and your new "friend" declares you an idiot, you get it: expect the unexpected. Undertale makes a name for itself with unusual storytelling techniques and combat mechanics, setting itself apart from the games it seems to imitate. It's also cleverly written and constantly subverts your expectations. There are so many wonderful experiences in store that are tempting to spoil, but to go into too much detail would ruin the element of surprise: one of Undertale's best assets.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">While it seems to be a game that's designed for RPG fans first and foremost, a lot of Undertale's jokes have universal appeal. A pair of comically incompetent skeletons regularly spout puns and jokes while attempting--and failing--to halt your progress, and the social ineptitude exhibited by one character when they try to express their feelings for another is a regular source of laughter. With clever characterization and unexpected responses to actions we've been conditioned to view as predictable, Undertale elicits laughter and delight with ease.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968500-image02.png" data-ref-id="1300-2968500" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1280px"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968500-image02.png"><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2968500-image02.jpg"></a><figcaption>"Take the ferry for 3 gold."</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">You're encouraged to stop and engage with NPCs rather than charge through the story, and you should, because the varied and entertaining cast of monsters reveal valuable information about the wider world. This quality isn't unique, but here, it leads to unusual exchanges that are filled with great quips, simultaneously poking fun at games and human nature alike. The script tip-toes into parody, but an air of earnest thought lifts it above mere mockery. Silly as it can be, Undertale delivers poignant observations that challenge the status-quo.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">It's also the sort of experience that encourages you to come back for a second or third round. This is especially true because, over the course of roughly five hours, you make a lot of decisions that impact the world around you. The importance of choice is often felt during combat, which lets you pick between fighting or talking your way out of conflict.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968503-image08.png" data-ref-id="1300-2968503" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 480px"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968503-image08.png"><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1406/14063904/2968503-image08.jpg"></a><figcaption>Sometimes the secret to winning is a little bit of love.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Trying to pacify opponents is a far more rewarding experience than simply fighting, and its a process that's unique to each type of enemy. To earn their favor, you have to analyse an enemy's behavior and figure out the right course of action. In one scenario, you can attempt to befriend a violent dog, in another, you might want to cheer up a ghost with low self-esteem; your success will depend on your ability to empathize and react. Navigating social puzzles is a refreshing change of pace for what seems like traditional combat, and the variety of distinct, entertaining enemies you engage with helps stave off a problem that's all-too-common in other RPGs: repetitive random encounters.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Because not all enemies are easily wooed, you eventually need to defend yourself regardless if you intend to fight or not. Undertale handles this with a quirky mechanic that feels out of place at first, but it eventually grows on you because it makes combat engaging and unpredictable in a good way. Enemy attacks appear as waves of projectiles that fly within a square pen, and as they fly by, you have to steer a small heart icon out of their flightpath to avoid taking damage. It's an unusual mechanic, but it's simple to understand and rewarding in the sense that it lets your reflexes-rather than statistics or dice rolls--dictate the outcome of a fight.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr" style="">The variety of distinct, entertaining enemies you engage with helps stave off a problem that's all-too-common in other RPGs: repetitive random encounters.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">Even within combat, Undertale layers on the humor. Sometimes you're dodging bullets, but you also need to watch out for frogs, arms with flexing biceps, and even the tears of a depressed opponent. Linking the shape, size, and behavior of projectiles with enemies' personalities keeps things challenging, and opens the door for even more laughs as you fend off absurd attacks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968505-image09.png" data-ref-id="1300-2968505" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1280px"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968505-image09.png"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2968505-image09.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2968505-image09.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hey, what are friends for?</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">It would be a crime not to mention Undertale's soundtrack, which is loaded with beautiful bit-based melodies that blend perfectly with the action on-screen. Each boss gets its own theme song, which do a great job of enhancing their particular personality. These tracks in particular bring energy and vigor, putting you on the edge of your seat as you try to fight or befriend your opponent. Outside of battle, tracks set the appropriate mood, too, from the quirky jingle in Temmie Village, to somber melodies that build tension near the end of the game. Regardless of its retro style, Undertale's soundtrack has timeless appeal and is great at evoking emotions.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Without spoiling the many ways it will screw with your expectations, it isn't possible to truly capture how wonderful Undertale is. You wouldn't know it with a passing glance, but it's one of the most progressive and innovative RPGs to come in a long time, breaking down tradition for the sake of invention, with great success.</p><p style=""> </p>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2015 14:16:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416315</guid><dc:creator>Tyler Hicks</dc:creator><media:content url="http://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1406/14063904/2968488-undertale2.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /></item>
<item><title>Starcraft 2: Legacy of the Void Review</title><link>http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/starcraft-2-legacy-of-the-void-review/1900-6416314/</link><description><![CDATA[<p style="">Over its 17-year run, the Starcraft series has become a cultural touchstone for the gaming public. The new expansion, Legacy of the Void, is the fifth release overall and the third in Starcraft II's sub-trilogy. With that mantle comes an extraordinary amount of pressure. The stories of Raynor's Raiders, Sarah Kerrigan, Zeratul, and countless other characters from this massive series await concrete resolution. Furthermore, Blizzard's stuck in the unenviable position of trying to update Starcraft's competitive foundation without overburdening a system that's largely been unchanged for almost two decades. We've seen the stage, we know the cast, and we've read the scripts. All that remains is to see it all come together as we ask one final question: Is this what we've all been waiting for? The answer is: absolutely.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Everything starts with the campaign, which is intended to tie up the bulky story of the game's three races: the human-inspired Terrans, the insectoid Zerg, and the hyper-advanced Protoss. These three factions have been at odds in an almost-constant war for quite some time. But as these things go, a new, more potent threat has emerged: Amon. He comes from an ancient race of beings that created both the Zerg and Protoss. He wants to unite all life by morphing them into chimeric hybrids through cross-breeding and extreme genetic engineering. His experiments and the corrupted minds of many of his followers are the focus of Legacy of the Void's story mode. With the help of old guard Protoss heroes Zeratul and Artanis, your goal is to dismantle Amon's massive armies and prevent his twisted vision of “perfection” from taking over the galaxy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968454-01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2968454" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968454-01.jpg"><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2968454-01.jpg"></a><figcaption>Legacy of the Void's missions use a series of unusual objectives, often with some additional challenge or complication to mix up the usual "build up base then attack" model of strategy game play.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">The whole adventure is riddled with familiar scenarios and, at times, is pretty goofy, but the game's voice cast sells their roles with such gravitas and conviction that it comes off as admirable camp instead a long list of eye-rolling clichés. Massive strategic battles often end with grand speeches about fighting for a cause, and Artanis and Zeratul consistently stand against teeming hordes of foes only to conquer them through braggadocio and strength of will. Their continued success and eventual victory is always assured, but it comes with such bombast that the adventure is endearing more often than not.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Structurally, the campaign also helps reinforce the idea that you're fighting a losing war against an overwhelming force. In many missions, you are outnumbered by enormous margins, and each mission plays faster than those in previous games in the series. After fights, you're often treated to beautiful, well-acted (albeit not terribly well-written) cut scenes that give detailed form to game's battlefields.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">While most of the single-player missions are excellent, they're not quite as diverse as they were in 2010's Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty. Most still come down to conquering specific points, protecting key areas, or holding out against an onslaught of foes for a set amount of time. What's included here is still more interesting than the missions from the last Starcraft II release, Heart of the Swarm. But it is disappointing that Blizzard, for all its tenacious attention to detail, didn't change up the proceedings a bit more. Where the characteristic Blizzard craftsmanship does come into play, though, is the revamped multiplayer modes.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr" style="">What's included here is still more interesting than the missions from the last Starcraft II release, Heart of the Swarm.</p></blockquote><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968460-04.jpg,http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968461-05.jpg,http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968462-06.jpg,http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968463-07.jpg,http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968464-08.jpg,http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968465-09.jpg,http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968466-10.jpg,http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968467-11.jpg,http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968468-12.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2968460,1300-2968461,1300-2968462,1300-2968463,1300-2968464,1300-2968465,1300-2968466,1300-2968467,1300-2968468" data-resize-urls="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2968460-04.jpg,http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2968461-05.jpg,http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2968462-06.jpg,http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2968463-07.jpg,http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2968464-08.jpg,http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2968465-09.jpg,http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2968466-10.jpg,http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2968467-11.jpg,http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2968468-12.jpg" data-resized="" data-resize-url=""><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968460-04.jpg" ><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2968460-04.jpg"></a><a href="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968461-05.jpg" ><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2968461-05.jpg"></a><a href="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968462-06.jpg" ><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2968462-06.jpg"></a><a href="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968463-07.jpg" ><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2968463-07.jpg"></a><a href="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968464-08.jpg" ><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2968464-08.jpg"></a><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968465-09.jpg" ><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2968465-09.jpg"></a><a href="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968466-10.jpg" ><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2968466-10.jpg"></a><a href="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968467-11.jpg" ><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2968467-11.jpg"></a><a href="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968468-12.jpg" ><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2968468-12.jpg"></a></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Anyone who's been playing strategy games for a while can often provide a pretty consistent list of grievances against the genre. In games with others, the first two or three minutes (or longer) are very important, but they're largely the same match to match. That, combined with longer skirmishes in general, leads to frustrations about openers for lots of people. If Legacy of the Void makes one critical change, it is that players now start with many more resource gatherers, and the abilities of each race's starting base have been tweaked slightly to smooth out that opening and help people get to the meat of the game faster.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">This makes the game a bit less forgiving for new players, but it evens out a problem that has plagued the series and strategy games in general for decades. To balance out the abrasiveness-for-new-players problem, Legacy of the Void adds a new mode named after one of the game's most iconic units: Archon.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Archon mode puts two players together and has them share one base, one pool of resources, e.t.c. The hope here is twofold. Those not familiar with Starcraft's hulking and often merciless competitive multiplayer modes can have an experienced player show off different pieces of the game and guide them through a match. On the higher level, though, it opens up two elements of play: macro- and micromanagement. Hypothetically, this should allow two experienced players to handle a lot more than they normally could. One can focus on maintaining the economy, gathering resources, and keeping up with upgrades and research, while the other can focus on the minute, precise movements necessary for optimal troop management. This lowers the total skill ceiling for multiplayer matches in general and helps players specialize.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968455-02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2968455" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2968455-02.jpg"><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2968455-02.jpg"></a><figcaption>Like the previous two Starcraft II games, you'll be able to change up your units for missions, refocusing their abilities to meet specific objectives.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">In my experience, Archon handily succeeds at both. I've helped guide newbies to keep them from feeling lost or overwhelmed by the nuance and complexity inherent in competitive Starcraft, and I've worked with friends to take on much better players than any of us could handle otherwise. I've always been great at keeping supplies running smoothly, but I'm rubbish when it comes to directing individual soldiers, so having someone else take up that load helped me focus on not only what I was good at but also the parts of the game I enjoy most.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">New units and subtler changes to the multiplayer game are also surprisingly valuable additions to Starcraft's stable of warriors. The Protoss get Adepts, ranged masters who can teleport, bypassing stationary defenses. Like the Terrans' Reaper--added previously in Wings of Liberty--the Adept are intended to harass fortified positions and disrupt your opponents' plans. Disruptors fill another key role in the grand Protoss line-up. They are walking bombs for clearing tight clusters of foes--much like the Zerg Baneling.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr" style="">Those looking for some resolution to the conflicts that started way back in 1998 will almost certainly come away satisfied.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">Terrans, for their part, get Cyclones and Liberators, new medium-armored ground and air units with automated turrets to target foes. Zerg get the Ravager, an evolution of the Roach. They are slow but effective artillery. Finally, the Zerg Lurker from Starcraft: Brood War also makes its long-awaited return. Each of these units has held up over months of beta play-testing, and they offer valuable additions to new strategies or new threats that players will need to cope with. The only problem I've seen so far is that after steadily adding new units and features for the past 17 years, Starcraft is getting a little big for itself, and there's often too much to manage--a complaint Blizzard seems to have predicted with the Archon mode. Surely, plenty of people can handle the new, larger game, but I struggled with higher-level play when I didn't have a friend along to help.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">It's hard to say whether this suite of changes will help keep Starcraft II abreast of more popular eSports competitors, such as League of Legends or Dota 2, but it's clear that Blizzard's trying to offer something to everyone. High-end players get the additional challenge of managing or adapting to six new units and compensating for one of the biggest changes competitive play has yet seen--faster match openings and splitting macro- and micromanagement with Archon mode. Newbies have plenty of new ways to acclimate themselves to the most refined version of Blizzard's classic strategy series yet.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Those looking for some resolution to the conflicts that started way back in 1998 will almost certainly come away satisfied, even if Starcraft's writing has become comically weighty in recent years. Legacy of the Void doesn't quite manage the brilliance of Wings of Liberty, but it's a worthy note to leave the franchise on.</p><p style=""> </p>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2015 13:55:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416314</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Starkey</dc:creator><media:content url="http://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1406/14063904/2968439-lov.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /></item>
<item><title>Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash Review</title><link>http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-tennis-ultra-smash-review/1900-6416313/</link><description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" style="">Thanks to Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash, I recently set a new personal record: "Most time spent swearing at a kids' game." Some of that profanity was good-natured, a product of the competitive tension that lurks just below the colorful, star-studded surface of most Mario sports titles. Some of it, however, stemmed from actual frustration. While Ultra Smash successfully recreates the basic mechanics that earned earlier titles Mario Tennis and Mario Power Tennis critical acclaim more than a decade ago, it fails to solve a handful of underlying design issues and omits much of the content offered by its predecessors.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">There is, for example, no tutorial mode. There's a rudimentary text tutorial buried so deep in one corner of the main menu that you can't even navigate to it using the Pro Controller, but it's too superficial to prove truly useful. You can easily hit random buttons and figure things out as you go (this is a light, arcadey take on tennis, after all), but eventually, you're going to run up against an AI opponent who crushes you with maneuvers that require a bit more technique. I got destroyed by an embarrassing number of near-unreturnable Ultimate Smashes before I finally figured out how to reliably execute them myself, rather than simply mashing what I assumed was the appropriate button.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2888011-mariotennis_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2888011" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2888011-mariotennis_001.jpg"><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1197/11970954/2888011-mariotennis_001.jpg"></a><figcaption>Need some extra help racking up wins in Knockout Challenge? Grab an Amiibo of any character already in the game to add a helping hand.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Throwing players in the deep end and asking them to learn through experimentation isn't an unforgivable sin, but it did lead to plenty of early frustration that could have easily been avoided. Given the time gap between games, even franchise fans like myself need a way to brush up, and new mechanics like jump shots deserve more than a random load screen tip. Generally speaking, games are more fun when you understand how to play them effectively.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Unfortunately, basic instruction isn't the only thing missing from Ultra Smash; it also lacks any kind of tournament or career modes. Instead, the game offers only Knockout Challenge, which pits players against every single character one by one, with ever-escalating difficulty. This structure creates a compelling sense of progress, but the mode as a whole yields little reward. Once you make it to 15 consecutive knockouts, you're presented with a congratulatory menu screen and the "Star" version of the character you guided to victory--though Star Peach, for example, doesn't look or play any differently from regular Peach. The journey can be challenging, even fun, but after a single trip through the Knockout gauntlet, there's little motivation to grind through again with other characters.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2888016-mariotennis_005.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2888016" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.56252412196063" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2888016-mariotennis_005.jpg"><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1197/11970954/2888016-mariotennis_005.jpg"></a><figcaption>The GamePad serves only as a second screen here, but that's invaluable during local multiplayer. </figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">That leaves only three main modes, all of which are essentially quickplay variations: Mega Battle, Standard Classic Tennis, and Simple Classic Tennis. Mega Battle includes everything the game can throw at you: Mega Mushrooms that gigantify your character, "chance shots" that power up your returns when you execute the correct type of shot from specific glowing spots that appear on the court, and jump shots, which add extra speed and bounce height to the ball. Standard tennis removes the mushrooms, and Simple tennis removes all three power-ups. If you're just looking for some quick tennis action, these three modes provide an adequate fix with minimal hassle. If you were hoping for something more substantial, however, Ultra Smash can't help.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">In fact, Ultra Smash doesn't even contain the goofy party modes that gave earlier Mario Tennis games both whimsy and variety. Old favorites like Item Battle and Ring Shot--which added some novel twists to the basic gameplay--are simply gone, leaving us with only Mega Ball Rally, which plays identically to the quick-play modes with the exception of its perpetually shrinking ball. It makes for a decent diversion, but because it's so similar to the game's other modes, it ultimately adds little to the overall experience.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Even the character roster--though respectably large and packed with all the usual suspects--doesn't create meaningful gameplay variety. While characters in past games possessed unique "power shots," Ultra Smash's 16 competitors play largely the same. Sure, Bowser is noticeably slower than Yoshi and Walugi has better reach than Toad, and those differences did prove noticeable enough that I had to adjust my strategy. But these adjustments were never severe enough to make the core gameplay feel fundamentally different. As with the game’s modes, the character options are adequate, but in no way exciting, inventive, or memorable.</p><blockquote data-size="medium" data-align="right"><p dir="ltr" style="">As with the game’s modes, the character options are adequate, but in no way exciting, inventive, or memorable.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">Thankfully, local and online multiplayer stop Ultra Smash from sliding too far into mediocrity. The opponent AI is serviceable--providing a reasonable challenge that'll keep you engaged long enough to hone your skills--but nothing beats yelling in your buddy's face when you counter his sneaky drop shot with an earth-shattering smash. Playing with friends allows the underlying mechanics to deliver those dramatic moments you expect from an intense, high-energy sports game, and thankfully, there's just enough nuance for competition to feel legitimate. You gradually figure out you can counter slices with topspin, deliver jump shots by reaching the ball at the peak of its arc, and crowd the net to force your opponent out of position. As a result, the action is not only fast and fun, it also evokes the "just one more match" competitiveness.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">In keeping with the rest of the game, Ultra Smash's online component is pretty bare-bones, offering only Mega Battle, Standard, and Simple game types with no option to choose a court or play multiple matches against the same opponent. However, the net-code held up fine during my time playing online, so at least you can enjoy all the basics without worrying too much about your internet connection. Local multiplayer is a bit more robust, allowing you to choose any of the eight unlockable court types while throwing Mega Ball Rally back into the mix as well. Plus, as I mentioned, you get to yell in people's faces--which is always a plus.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2888014-mariotennis_004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2888014" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2888014-mariotennis_004.jpg"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1197/11970954/2888014-mariotennis_004.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1197/11970954/2888014-mariotennis_004.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Unfortunately, you may find yourself yelling at the game just as often. For example, you're given almost no warning before Mega Mushrooms wear off and your character shrinks. If you happen to be chasing a ball when that happens, you'll miss your shot simply due to bad luck. Chance shots can also seem confusing and unfair at times. You have no way to conjure a chance shot; they simply appear randomly around the court. Needless to say, it's a little frustrating to have no control over a something that can decide a match--though at least the game seems to use chance shots to level the playing field when matches start to become lopsided. The worst moments, however, are those annoying instances when a ball bounces straight over your head because you simply couldn't tell how high it bounced. It's pretty hard not to feel cheated when that happens.</p><p style="">Considered as a whole, Ultra Smash does just enough to get by. At moments it shines and at others it frustrates, but mostly it just coasts. Without substantial content to drive longevity, you may end up switching back to Mario Kart sooner than later, but if you're playing online--or better yet, with your friends at home--you'll likely overcome the game's frustrations and squeeze a solid few hours of fun out of its fast-paced, power-up-driven action.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2015 07:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416313</guid><dc:creator>Scott Butterworth</dc:creator><media:content url="http://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1197/11970954/2888021-mariotennis_010.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /></item>
<item><title>Game of Thrones: Episode Six — The Ice Dragon Review</title><link>http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/game-of-thrones-episode-six-the-ice-dragon-review/1900-6416312/</link><description><![CDATA[<p style="">The finale of <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series">Telltale's Game of Throne</a>s series finally takes into account the choices you've made in the past five episodes. There have been tough decisions aplenty since <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/game-of-thrones-episode-one-iron-from-ice-review/1900-6415979">Episode One</a>'s launch last December, although they never quite felt as though they were connected to something more meaningful down the line. When interrogated, did you tell Cersei what she wanted to hear? Or maybe you sided with Margaery? Were you honest with Daenerys Targaryen? And did you brazenly stand up to the Whitehills, or did you bend the knee and bide your time?</p><p dir="ltr" style="">In Episode Six, The Ice Dragon, it's time to pay the piper and suffer the consequences of all these choices. And although this episode leans a little too heavily on some odd elements that feel out of character for the Game of Thrones universe, the climax of the Forresters' story brews a perfect mix of anxiety, heartbreak, and a smidge of genuine horror.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">We open on our scattered heroes in their direst hour. Gared, with Sylvi and a wounded Cotter in tow, finally finds the North Grove, and it's nothing like he imagined. Mira is straddling the line between continuing the fight to save her family and abandoning the endeavor to save herself from disgrace and other awful punishments. Back at Ironrath, the remaining Forresters are rallying for a showdown against the Whitehills but are struggling to find a way to beat them without endangering their captive little brother, Ryon.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1547/15470456/2966625-gared+bear.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2966625" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1547/15470456/2966625-gared+bear.jpg"><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1547/15470456/2966625-gared+bear.jpg"></a><figcaption>Look at this bear!</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">It's apparent the moment the episode opens that the end is nigh for our friends in House Forrester, and that everything you've made them do in the name of the family will come down to one final struggle. Depending on the choices you've had each individual character make, Episode Six is either a perilous minefield of ugly choices, or it offers more breathing room for you to manipulate circumstances in your favor. For example, Mira's tale of currying favor and keeping her loyalties finally comes to its heartbreaking head; if you've stood by Margaery she may stand by you too, but Sera is another story. Being a good friend could cost you your own safety--or your honesty and openness could win you a strong ally. Where her story goes is entirely dependent on how you've had Mira play the social circles in King's Landing, and the tiniest decisions she's made in the past can either come back to bite her or save her skin.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">The same is true for all other members of House Forrester as our journey with them comes to a close. A major decision you had to make at the end of the previous episode completely alters the chain of events for the finale. Depending on that choice, you'll have a different set of options for staving off the Whitehills' invasion of Ironrath, down to the place, time, and allies you have when the final conflict starts. These diverging paths result in two entirely different episodes--one more focused on stealth and cunning, the other a little more tailored to brute-forcing your way--and it's worth going back and playing twice to see how both decisions play out.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1547/15470456/2966626-whitehill+army.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2966626" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1547/15470456/2966626-whitehill+army.jpg"><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1547/15470456/2966626-whitehill+army.jpg"></a><figcaption>Someone's overcompensating...</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">In fact, if you're one of those players who needs to replay narrative-driven games to see all possible outcomes, The Ice Dragon may give you a headache. In addition to the two differing experiences dictated by the final moment of Episode Five, there are at least a dozen different branching routes to get to the end of the episode. I played through the episode four separate times, taking several stops to rewind to specific moments to see things unfold differently. It's a lot to unpack, and having so much variety in the finale has allowed the series--which has had its highs and disappointing lows--to end on a deeply emotionally note.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Without getting into spoilers, here's just a small description of how deep the rabbit hole of decision goes in The Ice Dragon: Depending on who is in charge at Ironrath, your plan of attack against the Whitehills changes. On several occasions, you're tempted to call off your plans. And if you do, you could endanger someone dear to you. But if you stick to the plan, you may lose someone else. And even if everything goes according to the plan, there's still the chance that something you've done episodes prior will result in something terrible happening to someone else. It's a nasty web of tension and grief that grants the series its perfect tragic ending, in true Game of Thrones style.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1547/15470456/2966628-mira.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2966628" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1547/15470456/2966628-mira.jpg"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1547/15470456/2966628-mira.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1547/15470456/2966628-mira.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mistakes were made.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">In other instances, small, seemingly unimportant decisions made at the beginning of the episodes can mean life and death for others, or whether or not you get your way. Being cocky to a potential new ally could cost you their respect. Allowing someone you love to stay near the front lines of battle could result in a terrible end of them later--and if you sent them away beforehand, they may be angry, but at least they'll be safe. It's a delicate balancing act, and the tension these decisions create has a lasting effect This episode is very good at making you second-guess yourself.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">There are also some terribly gross moments that, in typical Telltale fashion, you'll be pressing buttons to complete yourself. If you thought helping Clementine stitch up her own arm was terrible, The Ice Dragon presents a particularly gruesome situation that trumps DIY stitches by miles. It's a gut-wrenching moment on both an emotional and physical level, and you never see it coming.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">This episode's unpredictability is a first for Telltale's series. In previous episodes, you always had at least some sense of where things were going. You had a feeling Mira would have to choose between Tyrion and Cersei, and Margaery would be mad either way. You knew Asher would screw up his mission for Daenerys. You saw Talia's descent into a vengeful young woman coming. But The Ice Dragon throws no fewer than three plot twists at you, and it does so in moments that catch you entirely off guard. They are well-placed and well-executed, making the finale the most uneasy and traumatic episode in the series.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Like episodes before it, The Ice Dragon treads ground familiar to those who watch Game of Thrones. We go to The Wall and to King's Landing, see Ramsay Bolton's cruelty and Cersei Lannister's cunning firsthand. We meet Wildlings and the Night's Watch, pit fighters and slave traders. We see all these things in the source material; they all appear in the stories of the Starks. In the game, it felt as though we were watching the same story played out with a different cast. But Telltale's Game of Thrones takes some surprising turns in its later episodes, and although the Forresters' tale isn't as grand as the Starks', it does capture the desperation of one family to protect their honor and each other, no matter what the cost.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1547/15470456/2966629-rodrik+army.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2966629" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1547/15470456/2966629-rodrik+army.jpg"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1547/15470456/2966629-rodrik+army.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1547/15470456/2966629-rodrik+army.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Keeping my fingers crossed for the Beskha/Rodrick buddy cop spin-off.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">However, The Ice Dragon introduces more magical elements into the series--elements that feel like they would be more at home in Harry Potter than Game of Thrones. They feel a little too deus ex machina, and just a tad too fantastical to not roll your eyes at. I recognize that Game of Thrones contains its fair share of the eerie, including snow zombies and women birthing shadow creatures, but the show never presents the supernatural as something that's just hanging around waiting to be utilized. There are no overt magic spells or magical people, and their presentation has always been spooky rather than spectacle. But in Telltale's game, the circumstances and characters connected to these elements are shocking and a little sad, but the magic bits feel so out of place it's hard to invest in that part of the plot.</p><p style="">In the end, Telltale's Game of Thrones succeeds in telling a violent, sad story that feels very much at home in the world of Westeros. By the finale, the danger feels real and your choices feel like they have mattered. At times the episodes pass over ground well-trodden by the original series and the game feels more like an adaptation of the source material than a standalone story, but the introduction of several unpredictable plot twists makes up for the predictability of its earlier episodes. Telltale's Game of Thrones delivers grand battles and unavoidable heartbreak, and despite some out-of-place or overused elements from the source material, it's a journey in Westeros worth having.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2015 00:01:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416312</guid><dc:creator>Alexa Ray Corriea</dc:creator><media:content url="http://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1547/15470456/2966621-gared+tree.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /></item>
<item><title>Star Wars Battlefront Review</title><link>http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-battlefront-review/1900-6416311/</link><description><![CDATA[<p style=""><a href="http://www.gamespot.com/star-wars-battlefront">Star Wars Battlefront</a> reminds me why I love Star Wars. Its skirmishes unfold across iconic planets, with gorgeous landscapes and sweeping vistas on a massive scale. Endor's trees dwarf us. Tatooine's desert stretches for miles. And when the battle music reaches its peak, and I glide over Hoth's frozen trenches, I'm right back in my childhood living room, watching The Empire Strikes Back for the first time.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">But Battlefront lacks the longevity that makes its source material great. It offers initial engagement, and for the first 10 hours, it swept me through its harrowing firefights at a rapid pace. But then the cracks began to show. In the end, Battlefront feels more like an homage to Star Wars than a substantial Star Wars game in itself.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">And yet, what a beautiful homage this is: dynamic lighting, vivid textures, windswept forests--developer DICE has crafted a nuanced, detailed world begging for a closer look, enveloping you at every turn. Rain glistens on drooping leaves. Icy crystals extend from cavern walls. You can even see clouds of dust billow across Tatooine's arid scenery.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">This is all stunning, of course, but it's Battlefront's sound design that truly reels you in. The ambient wildlife surrounds you and explosions carry through bunker walls, even as the pitter patter of rain strikes ferns in the wind. It speaks volumes that I considered turning the ubiquitous soundtrack off at times, just to hear the detail in Battlefront's world.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1557/15576751/2966667-review_starwarsbattlefront_20151113.00_01_56_33.still004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2966667" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.56232091690544" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1557/15576751/2966667-review_starwarsbattlefront_20151113.00_01_56_33.still004.jpg"><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1557/15576751/2966667-review_starwarsbattlefront_20151113.00_01_56_33.still004.jpg"></a><figcaption>Luke's force push is best used against groups.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Beneath all this grandeur, however, are shallow experiences. Maps look fantastic, yes, but they lack focused design. Endor's undergrowth lends cosmetic appeal, but not much cover. Hoth's barren fields impart a sense of distance, but few creative sight lines.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">There are exceptions in some of Battlefront's locales, however--Tatooine's blend of exterior and interior environments, for instance, creates engaging battles from one match to the next. By darting into a nearby bunker, I avoided AT-ST fire. This also allowed me to flank a trio of enemy soldiers at a nearby capture point, and with a barrage of grenade launcher rounds, I cleared them out. Battlefront's best maps encourage these tactics across its various game modes.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">And make no mistake, there's an abundance of game modes here. Star Wars Battlefront offers nine competitive variants, each of them distinct, for better or worse.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">There's the spectacular Heroes vs. Villains, which plays out exactly how it sounds: as if a box of Star Wars action figures came to life and, unsure of what to do next, resorted to violence. There's Droid Run, a unique variation of zone control in which the zones shift locations throughout the match. And then there's Walker Assault.</p><blockquote data-align="center" data-size="large"><p dir="ltr" style="">Battlefront feels more like an homage to Star Wars than a substantial Star Wars game in itself.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">This is Battlefront at its best. Walker Assault offers more emergent gameplay moments and, in contrast to much of the game's combat elsewhere, it lends the sense of a bigger objective. Imperials escort--and rebels attempt to destroy--AT-ATs as they march toward the base at the end of a path. That dichotomy between objectives means a different experience for both sides, and with numerous offensive and defensive options, battles unfold with surprising variety.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">My favorite match took place on Endor. As a member of the Imperial team, I prioritized speed over anything else, sprinting along pathways toward Rebel uplink stations. If they captured enough of these, they would call more Y-wings in for bombing runs against our quadrupedal machine. So of course, I wanted to protect those stations.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">But as the game progressed, and both sides adapted to the other's strategy, things changed. The Rebels made better use of their defensive turrets and whittled away at the AT-AT's health during bombing runs. So I began sniping from Ewok tree structures above the battle, focusing my aim on enemies operating laser turrets. In the end, we still lost--a well timed orbital strike brought our offensive juggernaut to its knees--but the battle remained engaging throughout. Walker Assault is the embodiment of innovative game modes.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1557/15576751/2966739-review_starwarsbattlefront_20151113.00_03_42_21.still003-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2966739" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.56226765799257" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1557/15576751/2966739-review_starwarsbattlefront_20151113.00_03_42_21.still003-1.jpg"><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1557/15576751/2966739-review_starwarsbattlefront_20151113.00_03_42_21.still003-1.jpg"></a><figcaption>This battle isn't canonical at all.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">I also spent a lot of time with Survival, Battlefront's version of a wave-based cooperative option. And despite this idea being beaten to death in the last two console generations, Survival offers a welcome respite from Battlefront's competitive modes. Working with one other teammate against Stormtroopers, AT-STs, Imperial probe droids, as we collect power-ups through Hoth's Rebel base, or Sullust's hangar bay, grants a compelling teamwork experience.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">However, just as many of Battlefront's modes feel uninspired, or even poorly designed. Blast and Cargo are slight variations on team deathmatch and capture the flag, respectively, and are only exciting for several matches. After that, I had seen what felt like every possible scenario take place. Hero Hunt--in which a team of soldiers hunts down a Jedi, Sith, or bounty hunter--is imbalanced to the point of being frustrating. I grew tired of firing endless blaster rounds at Boba Fett right before he killed me with a wrist rocket--over, and over, and over. Battlefront has a depth of game modes, but only a few have much depth.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Every so often, outlandish events bring life to proceedings. There are cases when Luke Skywalker cuts through an AT-ST, or an errant rocket collides with an unlucky TIE Fighter. I've seen Emperor Palpatine corkscrew into a group of Rebels. I also watched a crafty Rebel heave a grenade at an AT-ST as she jetpack jumped over it. I was too amazed to even shoot her. Battlefront excels when it places me in this Star Wars fantasy world, where Leia squares off with Darth Vader, or Han Solo shoulder charges a low-flying TIE Interceptor.</p><blockquote data-align="right" data-size="medium"><p dir="ltr" style="">If nothing else, Star Wars Battlefront is an exercise in pure spectacle, laid out in all of its neon glory.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">But these moments don't feel as novel after Battlefront's early hours. This traces back to one root cause: Battlefront's combat can be monotonous. By and large, it consists of medium range gunfights where opponents hold the trigger for two seconds and hope they're the one left standing. Getting shot from a distance, on the other hand, often meant sprinting in another direction, rather than seeking nearby cover and planning a counterattack. There's not much thought in modes outside of Walker Assault, and I seldom felt as if I was impacting battles, or as if my skill played any wider purpose.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Vehicle combat, however, does offer some variety. Although X-Wings, snowspeeders, TIE Interceptors and the Millennium Falcon all feel great, with intuitive controls and fluid maneuvers, they don't always play a huge part in combat. Airborne vehicles fly too fast over maps that are too small in comparison, so strafing runs are often futile. However, snowspeeders are essential in Walker Assault, as their tow cables can bring down the four-legged behemoths if used right. AT-STs can also turn the tide at crucial capture points across larger maps. I wish more vehicles followed suit.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1557/15576751/2966672-review_starwarsbattlefront_20151113.00_00_45_02.still005.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2966672" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.56232091690544" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1557/15576751/2966672-review_starwarsbattlefront_20151113.00_00_45_02.still005.jpg"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1557/15576751/2966672-review_starwarsbattlefront_20151113.00_00_45_02.still005.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1557/15576751/2966672-review_starwarsbattlefront_20151113.00_00_45_02.still005.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Fighter Squadron is an entirely vehicle-based mode.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">In a further attempt to encourage extended playtime, DICE does implement a progression system in its multiplayer, with everything from character skins to blaster variations, ion grenades to homing missile launchers. Some grenades do more damage to vehicles, while certain sniper rifles fire more accurate shots.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Aside from a few standout items such as the jump jet--which lets you leap across the map and into the fray--these unlocks don't change how you play in the long run. Trait cards, which grant you perks like radar masking or explosive damage resistance, are the most valuable options, and acquiring them felt worthwhile.They changed how I thought about my equipment loadouts: how they played into the current game mode, how they would help me in the long run, and how I might consider maps in a different way. Approaching Trait cards in the progression list offered me more incentive to play. They're gems in an otherwise bland array of abilities.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">If nothing else, Star Wars Battlefront is an exercise in pure spectacle, laid out in all of its neon glory. I can't help but smile when the Boba Fett guns down three fighters in a row from his Slave I ship, or a snowspeeder careens past with flames trailing in its wake. The first 10 hours are packed with these moments, and it's worth playing just to watch them unfold.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">But Battlefront doesn't go much deeper than its ambitious surface appeal. It front loads its best content, only to fade in quality as the hours roll by. Star Wars Battlefront's skin is beautiful, but its legs are shaking, and threaten to buckle with time.</p><p style=""> </p>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2015 21:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416311</guid><dc:creator>Mike Mahardy</dc:creator><media:content url="http://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1557/15576751/2966553-2848838-star%2Bwars%2Bbattlefront%2B_4-17_f.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /></item>
