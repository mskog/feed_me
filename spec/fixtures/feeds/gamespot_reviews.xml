<item><title>Beyond: Two Souls Review</title><link>http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/beyond-two-souls-review/1900-6416326/</link><description><![CDATA[<p style="">The PS4 port of Beyond: Two Souls doesn’t fix the game's core issues. It’s still a very stilted, awkward experience in spots, usually right after a stretch where the gameplay and narrative get everything right. What it does do--thanks to this edition’s best new feature, where the timeline-hopping narrative can be played in chronological order--is strip away some of the high-concept pretense and deliver a straightforward story that's stronger as a result.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Beyond: Two Souls is about the life of Jodie Holmes (performed by Ellen Page), a girl who, since birth, has been tethered to an otherworldly entity named Aidan. Naturally, having a poltergeist as an impulsive companion doesn’t exactly equal an ideal life--especially since Aidan’s presence leaves Jodie open to frequent visits from the malevolent side of the hereafter. But even when she’s not being dragged around by invisible horrors, Jodie still has to contend with Aidan’s mischievous tendencies. And on days when Aidan is calm, there’s just life as a socially awkward girl who sees things that nobody should ever have to see. We follow Jodie over a stretch of 15 years, watching her deal with the world--and the world deal with her--and make decisions that change the course of her life.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977881-beyondtwosouls2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2977881" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1280px"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977881-beyondtwosouls2.jpg"><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2977881-beyondtwosouls2.jpg"></a><figcaption>This experiment went well.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Beyond feels right at home on PS4. Textures are noticeably upgraded from the PS3 version and lighting improvements galore create an even more stunning cinematic experience. The actual playing of Beyond hasn’t changed significantly in the transition to PS4. For the most part, it’s still a copy-paste job from Heavy Rain. Most of your time is spent wandering through closed environments, looking for the magical prompt that signifies when you can interact with an object or person.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">In keeping with Quantic Dream's trademark style, action is handled by quick time events in a dynamic fashion, taking full advantage of the DualShock 4's motion-sensing functionality. The PS4 edition of the game does add a few tricky bits, where QTEs use diagonals instead of normal up-down-left-right prompts, but those only pop up in two of the chapters. The timing of the prompts seems stricter, which means that Jodie is liable to take a few more brutal hits when the going gets tough, but the QTEs don’t determine the course of the story so much as they bring the action to life. Yes, you could, in theory, just set the controller down during an action scene and let it play out on its own, but you’d be watching a sequence of Jodie getting the crap kicked out of her ad nauseum. Actively participating in Jodie's struggle is much more gratifying.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977895-beyondtwosouls4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2977895" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1280px"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977895-beyondtwosouls4.jpg"><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2977895-beyondtwosouls4.jpg"></a><figcaption>If only she had a Fulton baloon.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Through the course of the game, the best moments in each action scene require your input, whether you're jumping between moving vehicles, tossing soldiers into the road, stealing a motorcycle, blowing past a police garrison, or saving people from a burning building. There are even a few scattered sequences of stealth combat, where Jodie tackles hapless bad guys into the dirt.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Beyond’s big hook, of course, is the fact that, any time you have full control over Jodie, you can instantly switch to Aidan and roam the world as a phantom, floating through doors, walls, and objects, listening to secret conversations, force-pushing objects around, choking the life out of folks, or even possessing hapless victims. The seams of the gimmick show often. It’s built into the story that Aidan can actively hurt Jodie if he travels too far, but how far exactly seems to be determined by the needs of the scene rather than consistent logic.</p><blockquote data-size="large"><p dir="ltr" style="">Beyond feels right at home on PS4. Textures are noticeably upgraded from the PS3 version and lighting improvements galore create an even more stunning cinematic experience.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">Having said that, the puzzles, obstacles, and story points built around Aidan’s powers are wonderfully plotted. A painful goodbye interrupted by Jodie’s irritating father can be salvaged if you choose to give him a much-deserved goodbye choke. More than once, Aidan will have to rescue Jodie from a sticky situation by possessing one of her enemies, forcing him to kill his friends and then himself. Its seldom that we get to see a story through the eyes of a spirit, and the extent to which its used in Beyond leads to some fascinating conclusions.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">The chronological version of this story told in the new PS4 version is a marked improvement over the original, where the key points of Jodie’s life were scrambled up and presented as a random series of disparate moments as opposed to a life flashing linearly before her eyes. As a chronological narrative, we get a much better sense of the burden of Jodie’s powers, watching her grow from a curious but sheltered child into a rebellious teenager who longs to live in the real world, and ultimately, into a young woman who finds herself routinely beaten by society.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977893-beyondtwosouls3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2977893" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1280px"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977893-beyondtwosouls3.jpg"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2977893-beyondtwosouls3.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2977893-beyondtwosouls3.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Page and Dafoe deliver excellent performances.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Much of the story's impact can be laid at the feet of Page. Her performance, both vocal and physical, is powerful; it retreats to hollowly call upon the full weight of Jodie’s collective traumas in one scene, using the same trauma to fuel a deep, embittered rage in the next. Willem Dafoe brings a similar gravitas. His side of the script is steeped in exposition, especially toward the end, but there are times when he demonstrates genuine warmth and paternal concern for Jodie--traits we rarely see from Dafoe. The supporting cast varies. Kadeem Hardison, the only other “name” actor in the game, is solid in his role, but elsewhere, actors fail to keep up and weigh down scenes with poor acting that contrasts with Beyond's more capable cast members.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr" style="">Beyond remains an imperfect experience but is still compelling for what it accomplishes.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">They’re bound to Beyond's schizophrenic script, which flips between sequences of earnest, pensive drama, high-octane action, and well-directed but conceptually goofy supernatural blather. The highs are spectacular: The sequence where Jodie deals with homelessness stands out, and a scene where she reunites with a heavily medicated relative is brutally harrowing. The lows, however, are bewildering in their shallowness: An eye-rolling incident at a bar, a detour into Navajo mythology, and a character’s sudden shift into comic book villainy ultimately disappoint. Occasionally, there are scenes like Jodie’s solo mission to take down an African dictator, which, while delivering a stellar dose of action, feels disconnected from the overarching narrative.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Beyond remains a unique experience, even as the tools implemented in its creation have become commonplace. It's filled with concepts that are immediately odd and illogical, but if you accept them on their own terms, they add up to a fascinating if unconventional tale. Beyond remains an imperfect experience but is still compelling for what it accomplishes.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Dec 2015 10:01:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416326</guid><dc:creator>Justin Clark</dc:creator><media:content url="http://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1406/14063904/2977872-2198135861-REVIE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /></item>
<item><title>Yakuza 5 Review</title><link>http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/yakuza-5-review/1900-6416325/</link><description><![CDATA[<p style="">Diving back into Japan’s criminal underworld with Yakuza mainstay Kazuma Kiryu as its narrative anchor is like jumping into another season of a well-received cable TV drama. It usually doesn’t take eight years for a show to reach its fifth season but Yakuza 5 was worth the wait. It even manages to be more feature-rich than its predecessors thanks to a robust set of stories and minigames spread across multiple urban districts across Japan. Savoring Yakuza 5 is about being pulled in by not only its woven plotlines and energetic combat, but also the numerous activities that bring its world to life.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Just like the games of Brendan McNamara (<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/the-getaway">The Getaway</a>, <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/l-a-noire">L.A. Noire</a>), the Yakuza series has always belonged at that end of the urban open world game spectrum where gameplay takes a backseat to story. We’re talking about <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> levels of exposition through lengthy cutscenes. Yakuza 5’s heavy themes of honor among criminals and workplace loyalty are aptly presented through the lens and production values of a big budget TV show, and you’d be hard pressed to come up with any game outside this series that features this much melodramatic piano music.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977058-001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2977058" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.56331168831169" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977058-001.jpg"><img src="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2977058-001.jpg"></a><figcaption>Kazuma Kiryu hasn’t aged much since the original Yakuza, and he's never looked better.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">If there’s one key feature from <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/yakuza-4">Yakuza 4</a> that this sequel capitalizes on, it is the value of having multiple stories. As much as Kazuma Kiryu could be effective as a solo protagonist, having four other playable characters, each with their own lengthy and fleshed-out storylines, adds immense value to Yakuza 5. These journeys are personal, and plot threads intertwine like those of a Tarantino film, and converge at the end like a narrative Voltron.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Kazuma kicks off Yakuza 5 on an intriguing note: disguised as a taxi driver making a modest living in Fukuoka. Between highway racing challenges and standard driving missions, there’s a lot of entertaining taxi gameplay to distract you from the story for hours. Unlike other games of its ilk, Yakuza 5 treats driving around city streets as a challenge, with strict traffic laws to follow--until you get on the highways, where anything goes. Another chapter puts you in the shoes of ex-con Taiga Saejima, deep in a snowy forest and far away from the game's concrete jungles This leads to a surprisingly engrossing hunting minigame where stalking prey without startling them is harder than it looks--especially when the intensity of snowfall fluctuates frequently--causing you to take a breath and compose yourself before every shot.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr" style="">Although Yakuza 5 never attempts to be a real simulation of life in Japan, the areas of selective realism within are one of its biggest draws.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">Taxi racing and hunting are just two of myriad diversions that support Yakuza 5's tale, and with over two dozen types of minigames, there's a lot to discover when you're out and about. It’s brilliant that arcades in the game feature an arcade-perfect version of Virtua Fighter 2 and that Namco Bandai’s Taiko Drum Master exists, even if it only has a three-song playlist. Casino games like poker and baccarat are well-represented, as are traditional sports practice areas like batting centers and driving ranges. When enduring the failure of my fifth attempt at grabbing a plush toy from a UFO Catcher, I couldn’t help by recall my struggles at the similar games of chance in Shenmue, and in real life.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977059-003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2977059" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.56092607636068" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977059-003.jpg"><img src="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2977059-003.jpg"></a><figcaption>Yakuza 5 is the closest thing we'll get to a proper Taxi Driver video game. </figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Nothing in Yakuza 5 underscores the series’ passage of time more than Haruka Sawamura’s story arc. Originally the young girl who was the plot’s focal point in the first game, she is now sixteen years old. Her continued and consistent relevance in the series serves as one of the many rewards to fans who have followed Yakuza since the first game. In Haruka's world, there is only one sensible career path for a Japanese teenage girl: idol singer. I afforded myself one eyeroll at this unoriginal premise before I wholeheartedly jumped into the early stages of her burgeoning career.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Given the series’ history with rhythm-based action, mostly through karaoke, this chapter will be familiar to Yakuza fans. It’s not just about matching button inputs to on-screen prompts during a practice session in the dance studio. There are meet-and-greets with fans, appearances on various TV shows, and even dance-offs in the streets.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977061-002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2977061" style="width: 480px" data-ratio="0.56527043513623" data-width="480" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977061-002.jpg"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1406/14063904/2977061-002.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1406/14063904/2977061-002.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>Haruka’s songs are more infectious and tolerable than anything by Sega's Hatsune Miku.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Haruka’s variety show appearances are impressively authentic, not just with the banter between her and the host, but also with the lighting and camerawork. It’s not for everybody, but it's a welcome interlude from the heavy doses of suspense and intrigue in the other plotlines. Still, Yakuza 5 never veers too far from the beaten path, with Rival idols and conflicts with competing management companies providing a dash of drama to Haruka's tale.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">Although Yakuza 5 never attempts to be a real simulation of life in Japan, the areas of selective realism within are one of its biggest draws. I still remember walking into a convenience store in the first game and admiring the level of detail, from the magazines to the bright and unflattering overhead lighting. This and many other types of business look all the more detailed in Yakuza 5, right down to the pastel color schemes in the pharmacies. And as much as one can survive the game’s more hostile sections with a boost from energy drinks, sometimes you just want a bowl of health-replenishing ramen or curry. Given all of Yakuza 5’s urban attractions and the vibrancy of most of its various large locales, you’d think that Sega received a subsidy from the Japan National Tourism Organization.</p><p dir="ltr" style="">The core combat in Yakuza 5 is mostly unchanged since the first game and it’s a credit to the series that this hasn’t become totally stale after all these years. Fans will immediately recognize Kazuma’s fighting animations, especially when he’s smashing opponents’ faces with a unusual weapons, including the likes of a bicycle. The tried-and-tested combat serves Yakuza 5 well, but without any type of counter system for self-defense, it shows its age.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977060-004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2977060" style="width: 1280px" data-ratio="0.56061838893409" data-width="1280" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-embed-type="image"><a href="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2977060-004.jpg"><img class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2977060-004.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><noscript><img src="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2977060-004.jpg"></noscript></a><figcaption>You’d be surprised what Taiga Saejima can pick up.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr" style="">Make no mistake, though, there is depth to Yakuza 5's combat. Throws, dodges, and opportunities to learn new moves ensure that fights aren't a one-dimensional affair. The series was one of the first street brawlers to include context-sensitive environmental finishing moves, a feature that was improved upon by United Front Games’ Sleeping Dogs, and it's put to great use here. Smashing a thug’s face on the side of a building never gets old; it always looks brutal, but more importantly, it offers a gratifying sense of finality to a fight. As much as you can mash your way to victory with quick attacks, these deadlier moves are doubly effective in scaring off the other gangsters, turning a sixty-second brawl into a fifteen-second display of intimidating might. Of course, moments of slapstick complement the harsh side of combat, including the use of an injured foe as a weapon against his unfortunate buddies, adding insult to injury.</p><blockquote data-align="center" data-size="large"><p dir="ltr" style="">Yakuza 5 makes up for its modest shortcomings with enthralling diversions and eye-popping settings that compel one to look at travel deals to Japan.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="">While playing the prior games isn’t a prerequisite, loyal fans who have followed the Yakuza series up to this point will feel rewarded with every throwback, whether it’s the return of a supporting character or a revisit to a ramen shop that has remained in business for multiple games. Even if melee combat lacks the sophistication of modern action games, Yakuza 5 makes up for its modest shortcomings with enthralling diversions and eye-popping settings that compel one to look at travel deals to Japan. Come for the stories, but stick around for Yakuza 5's world; it's unconventional in the best way possible</p><p style=""> </p>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2015 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416325</guid><dc:creator>Miguel Concepcion</dc:creator><media:content url="http://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1406/14063904/2977049-7108485823-Yakuz.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /></item>
